WAVE ESSENCE OF PARTICLES

Center for MT&Anh, Hanoi, Vietnam.

D. M. Chi1

Abstract

We state several ideas based on the view-point of particle behaviour of
matter to explain wave character of photon and elementary particles. By using
Newton’s suggestion of light ray, we clarify integrally the behaviour of light
“wave”. And “wave” character of particles is also explained by the view-point
of particle.

1 Introduction

Today everybody believes that the matter has both particle character and wave character.

Following belief up to now, wave is understood as continuous change of any quantity
in period in space and in time with its immanent cause. With the view-point of particle
the periodic property puzzled everybody, and it is looked as a presence of wave.

Now, we think that there is still an other way to understand nature more accurately
and more consistently: we use still Newton’s ideas “along with ray of light there must be a
manifestation of some periodicity” to explain wave phenomena of the light and elementary
particles.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we show an explanation intuitionally
of interference of the light. And the interferential phenomenon of electron is illustrated
in Section 3. Conclusion is given in Section 4.

2 Interferential picture of the light

The electromagnetic ﬁeld can exit independently and so it includes invariant structures
(particles). The electromagnetic ﬁeld has periodicity and so this periodicity either goes
with particle by anyway or manifests in the distribution of particles in space and this
squadron of particles ﬂy along a ﬁxed ray,

created.

This picture is similar to the so-called wave.

Let us use this imagination of the light to explain how the interferential picture is

Suppose that there is a gun, and after each ﬁxed interval of time ∆t it shoots one
ball. Balls are alike in all their aspect. They ﬂy with the same velocity v in environment
without resistance force and their gravities are ignorable.

The “wave-length” - i.e. the distance between two balls - is λ = v.∆t. All balls are
electrized weak charge of the same sign, and they are covered with a sticky glue envelope so
that electrostatically propulsive force between them cannot win stickiness of glue envelope
when they touch together with small suﬃcient meeting angle. A target with two parallel
interstices in the vertical is set square with the axis of the gun and is also electrized weak
charge but diﬀerent from the sign of balls. The distance between two interstices is not too
large in comparison with the wave-length λ. And assume that sticky glue of balls does
not eﬀect on the target.

Thus, probability in order that any ball ﬂies through one interstice or the other is

identical. (The interstices are enough large that balls can ﬂy through easily).

After ﬂying past, balls are changed ﬂying direction with all possible angles in the

horizontal plane with deﬁnite probability distribution.

With such initial conditions, balls are in ‘dephasing’ with each other and, after over-
coming the target, balls that do not ﬂy through the same interstice are able to meet
together with a some non-zero propability. If meeting angle is enough small in order that
stickiness has eﬀect, two some balls will couple together to be a system, then change
direction and ﬂy on the bisector of meeting angle.

If behind the target and distant from the target a space d ≫ λ, a reception screen
is set parallel to the target, then on this screen we will harvest falling point locations of
single balls and couple balls.

Argumentation and calculation show that single balls (missed interference) form a
monotonous background of falling points, and couple balls (caused by interference) fall
concentratively and create deﬁnite veins on the background, depending on dephasing
degree of interfered balls.

Hence, from Newton’s idea and using quantities such as “wave-length”, “dephase”,
and so on results obtained is ﬁtted in ones calculated using wave behaviour. Furthermore,
they explain why, when amount of balls is not enough large (the time to do experiment
is short), the picture of falling points seems chaotic, randum. Only with a large number
of balls (the time to do experiment is long), interferential veins are really clear. This is
one that, if using wave behaviour, is impossible to explain.

Thus, if we consider the light as a system of particles that, in the most rudimentary
level, are similar above balls: they are attractable together and radiated periodically,
then the interference of the light is nothing groundless or diﬃcult to understand when
we refuse to explain it by using wave behaviour. Moreover, without wave conception the

2

D.M.Chi

physics/0001036

phenomena of the light is very bright, clear, and more unitary.

Such a view-point of the light requires to imagine again many problems, simultaneously

brings about new eﬀects that need to prove in experiment.

If there is a source that radiates continously separately light pulses of a ﬁxed thickness
and with a ﬁxed distance between pulses (Fig. 1), we can carry out a following experiment
(Fig. 2).

FREQUENCY
TRANSFER

Figure 1: Frequency transfer.

With two continously radiative sources we direct light pulses together with an inter-
secting angle α.
If the light
Interference presents only in the area ABCD of Fig. 1.
is wave, then to see interference we should set a photographic plate in the area ABCD,
because outside this area interference is impossible to present. Two light sources are
independent from each other, the stable condition of interferential veins is not ensured,
position of vains is changed incessantly, and the consequence is that on the photographic
plate we cannot obtain interferential veins.

But if the light is particle, then we always obtain interferential veins (in suitable
polarization condition) though the photographic plate is set inside or outside the area
ABCD.

Carrying out experiments according to this diagram we can check interferential ability
of the light of diﬀerent wave-lengths. Given two radiative sources of diﬀerent frequencies
by that way, we are able to see whether photons of diﬀerent frequencies is identical.

A consequence of particle behaviour is that we can make mirror-holography with any
reappear light source. This is drawn from the phenomenon that two photons interfered
together change direction and ﬂy on the the bisector of meeting angle.

In the conception of particle, frequency of a light wave is understood as number of
photons radiated in a unit of time to a deﬁnite direction. The photo-electric eﬀect,
therefore, is understood as follows: the more number of coming photons that collide to

electrons in a unit of time is, the higher energy that electrons gain is. If momenta of all
photons are of the same value, then it is possible that number of photons electrons gain
is proportional to light frequency, and thus momentum of each photon is proportional to
Plank’s constant ~. With such understanding, energy that electron gain from interfered
photons is higher than one from non-interferential photons.

With wave behaviour and imagined that atom sends spherical waves, then the photo-
electric eﬀect is impossible to explain as shown. But if thought that atom radiate directly
light, then because radiation is a wave process, in radiation process atom does not keep
still a place in space, thus it is diﬃcult to maintain that all energy quanta is transmitted
out space in a deﬁnite ray. Situation is the same for absorbing process of energy quanta.
For instance, electron is impossible to keep still a place to await absorbing all energy
quanta then moves to other position.

Thus, there is not any ﬁrm basis to say that energy is absorbed piecemeal quanta

E = ~ν.

3 Interferential picture of elementary particle

Let us consider interference of electron.

First of all we can conﬁrm that there would not be any experiment we gain interference
of electron if we used conditions as already stated for the light. Because with actual
experience electrons are not like as above balls with stickiness that lack of this ability
there is not any presence of interferential couples.

Interference of electron is completely diﬀerent, if using the word “interference”.

Suppose that there is an electron ﬂying to a block of matter made up from particles
heavier very much than electron. Each heavy particle in the block of matter is a scattering
center. Because of interaction, after ﬂying out of inﬂuential region of scattering center
electron is changed direction with an angle α in comparison with initial direction.

Assume that the deviation angle α is dependent on the aim distance ρ obeying on the

law a or b as on the ﬁgures.

Derivative of α with respect to ρ is equal to 0 at ρ = ρ0.
If all values of the aim distance ρ is the same probability for e, then the probability in
order that the particle e is deviated from the coming direction an angle (α0) is “inﬁnitely
large” in comparison with any other angle: ∂ρ
∂α
α=α0
It is necessary to say that α0 is inversely proportional to the momentum of e. The

higher the momentum of e is, the higher the direction conservability of its momentum
vector is, then the smaller the deviation angle α is. (That is just the basis of Broblie
relation.)

= ∞.

We bring in a quantity ǫ called the maximum divergence that measurement is accept-
able, that border rays deviated in comparison with the angle α a value ǫ belongs to still
that angle α. Thus, we can establish a function of probability density having the following
form, (Fig. 5),

The greater the sharpness of this distribution is, the greater the contrast of probability

densities between the angle α and its neighbouring angles.

Call average distance between two scattering centers 2R, then inﬂuence space of any

center (in the ﬁeld of the aim distance) is πR2.

The space, where the particle e is falled into and deviated an angle (α ± ǫ), is propor-

tional to π [(ρ + ∆ρ)2 − (ρ − ∆ρ)2] ≈ 4πρ∆ρ.

The probability in order that e scatters into the angle α is 4πρ∆ρ

However, using the above method to estimate the probability density with all direc-

large in comparison with that for all other angles. In that correlation, all deviation an-
gles that are diﬀerent from α0 should be ignored because they form only a monotonous
background. This has not inﬂuence on the qualitative accuracy of the law.

Consider i-th scattering experiment (each experiment there is only one e attended

with a constant momentum, the same for all experiments.)

Assume that all scatterings are elastic. The scattering process of e is easy to imagine

as Figures 7 and 8.

After the 1-th scattering, e can be deviated with any angle and ﬂy with any direction,
but all directions with highest probability (Pα0 = ∞) form a cone with the top at the
scattering center and an arrangement angle (2α0).

In the 2-nd scattering, the directions with highest probability of e’s trajectory form

the cones with angles (0, 2(2α0)). This is explained as follows.

Scattering centers in the block of matter distribute at random for e’s trajectory and
this random is always maintained by thermic ﬂuctuations, inelastic scatterings, ... So, on
the conic surface (1-2) there forms a brim - the locus of probability of 2-nd scattering
centers, is plotted as the brim (2-2) in the ﬁgure. At each point of the brim there exist
2-nd scattering centers with some probability.

Thus, in the 2-nd scattering at each point of the brim there forms a new probability
cone, similar to fomation at the 1-th scattering center. These probability cones interfere
with each other forming two collective cones with open angles 0 and 2(2α0) respectively.

Indeed, if we put a spherical surface of enough large radius and center coincident with
the 1-th scattering center, then cones intersect the spherical surface and form circles as
given in Figure 9.

Figure 9:

For simpliﬁcation, we are not concerned with curvature of the spherical surface. The

probability in order that the particle falls into any point of circles is identical.

Let us ﬁnd the probability density of e’s falling points on this surface. In the ﬁgure,
∆S , where ∆ℓ is the total length

it is clear that this density is proportional to the ratio ∆ℓ
of circles in an elementary surface ∆S (dS).

Solve this problem in the pole coordinate, the equation of circles in this coordinate is

By diﬀerentiating of Mρ over ρ then putting this derivative zero or substituting values

of ρ and dρ into (3) and approach ϕ → 0 we also obtain Mρ → ∞.

Thus, at maximum and minimum values of ρ the probability density Mρ is inﬁnitely

large (in comparison with other values of ρ).

The surface dS is equivalent to the volume angle dΩ, and ∆ℓ is equivalent to the

9

D.M.Chi

physics/0001036

probability in order that the particle scatters into that volume angle.

Therefore, we obtain that in the 2-nd scattering all possible directions with highest

probability of trajectories form two cones with open angles 0 and 2(2α0).

With similar argument we realize that at the 3-rd scattering the directions with highest
probability of e’s trajectories form cones with open angles 3(2α0), 1(2α0), 1(2α0), −1(2α0).
Generally, up to the n-th scattering there form probability cones of possible directions

of e’s trajectories with open angles n(2α0) , (n − 2)(2α0), ..., (n − 2m)(2α0).

Put a spherical surface as a catching screen with its axis coincident to the initial
direction of particle before coming to the target, and its radius much larger than the
thickness of the target. The center of the spherical surface is on the target and in the
coming point of scattering particle.

Hence, the probability cones forming at the last scattering intersect the catching screen

and form circle brims - These are locus of falling points with e’s maximum probability.

If n is even, we obtain an even number of brims; n is odd, we have an odd number
of brims. And in all times of experiment e always scatters n times, then on the catching
screen we obtain either an even number or odd number of brims, depending on even or odd
value of n. Of course, in one time of experiment, n has only value. Thus, the probability
intensity of obtained brims after total experiment Σ is dependent not only on decreasing
law from inner to outer but also on frequence of n, i.e. on the ratio in
Σ ; in is frequency
(number of occuring times of n) in total experiment Σ.

It is diﬃcult to deﬁne this frequency for every possible value of n. However, at the
most rudimentary, it is sure that spectrum of n’s values is not large3 and probability in
order that n has even or odd value is identical, then spectrum of diﬀeraction brims is
complete from (0) to (nmax).

From conditions of experiment we realize that the larger the matter density of the

target is the tickness is, the larger nmax is.

Here, once again we ﬁnd out that the diﬀeraction picture is only clear since the number
of particles taking in scattering are enough much. If they are is too little, on the screen we
see only a chaotic distribution of e’s marks, but on the contrary, if they are too much and
the catching screen is a photographic plate, then all points on the screen are saturated
and diﬀeraction brims are hidden.

The scattering of light particles in a radial ﬁeld is described in mechanics as follows

where ϕ is the angle made by radius vector of particle’s position on the trajectory and
radius vector of particle’s extremal point (~r0), M is the momentum of the particle, E is
the energy and m is mass of the particle, and U(r) is the potential of the ﬁeld.

(cid:1)

3 We are only interested particles that overcome through the target.

10

D.M.Chi

physics/0001036

If the potential of the ﬁeld U(r) has the form U(r) = ± A

r , then from the above formula
we can express ϕ as a function of the aim distance ρ since the upper bound approaches
to inﬁnity, thus the deviation angle α = π − 2ϕ is also a function of ρ.

Calculations give the result that the derivative of ϕ(ρ) with respect to ρ is not equal
to zero at any position. That proves that the condition to have “wave-like” diﬀeraction
is not satisﬁed.

If in fact the potential of nuclear ﬁeld had the form as above, then the ability in order
that electron would fall into nucleus has a very large probability. This is not compatible
with the fact4.

We can suppose a supplement (not interested in quantum mechanics) as:

far from
the attracting center a distance a there is a surface L. This surface changes trajectory
of scattering particles. Because it is not absolutely hard (in the present region of the
surface, the potential ﬁeld has some form), there happens a slippery eﬀect of particle on
the surface. This softens variation of deviation angle of trajectory α, and then α is still
a continous function of ρ. Thus, the momentum of scattering particle is unsurpassed a
some value in order to unbreak elasticity of the surface. Otherwise, the momentum of
scattering particle is larger than a supposed criterion, the surface L is broken to form the
light radiation. Some radiation forms can belong to Trerenkov or Compton eﬀect.

In summary, with this supplement, α is a function of ρ with dependence as Figure 10.

where ρ0 ≈ a and hence, the condition to have the “wave-like” diﬀeraction is satisﬁed.

4 Conclusion

Thus, we show in rather detail some ideas based on the particle behavour of matter. By
using Newton’s model of light ray we have explained rather completely “wave” behaviours
of the light. The polarization of the light is a eﬀect of particle behaviour: two photons

4 To avoid this there was a quantum mechanics.

11

D.M.Chi

interfere with each other forming a system with axisymmetry. The experiment set as
Figure 1 is important. Carrying on this experiment will take part in conﬁrmation of
light’s particle behaviour. Its detailed results will open up new ideas, and new directions
of research.

The wave character of elementary particle, electron is typical, can be explained by
pure particle behaviour. This give us a similarity between the wave function in quantum
mechanics and the vector function of particle behaviour.

The motion of any particle can be expressed as a vector, whose direction points out
particle’s motion direction at a given point of trajectory, and whose module expresses
probability amplitude of particle ﬂying in that direction. Thus, the probability trajectory
of particle is completely able to expressed as a vector function

ψ = A(α(t))eiα(t),

α(t) is the deviation angle in comparison with the initial direction, is a function of time;
A(α) is the probability of particle ﬂying with the angle α.

But this does not mean that the particle expressed as above will have a really wave

character.

If we ﬁnd a way to express the value of α(t) by the value of energy-momentum of
scattering particle, parameters of scattering environment, and simpliﬁcation: α(t) is con-
tinously independent of time but discontinously dependent on time (due to the fact that
scattering centers are discontinous), then the vector function is not basically diﬀerent
from the wave function in quantum mechanics. Doing with appropriate operators for
probability function, we can obtain correlative quantities.

Hence, from the natural idea of particle behaviour of matter we can discover further
natural phenomena. One of the most host problems today is inﬂation of the universe
aﬃrmed from the red-shift of Doppler’s eﬀect. However, if the space between observer
and light source is vacuum, then the explanation of the red-shift based on Doppler’s
eﬀect is fully satisfactory. But in fact the universe is ﬁlled with gravitational ﬁelds,
macrometric and micrometric objects as stars and clusters. Therefore, these problems
had been re-examined in further detail by us, with consideration actual inﬂuences of
interstellar environment on frequency shift. This is only realized by foundation of particle
behaviour of the light. The existence of cosmic dusts as motional scattering centers is an
essential condition to happen scattering-interference processes of the light when it ﬂies
through the interstellar environment. In turn, these scattering-interference processes lead
to the shift of light frequency. Our results give a reliable conﬁrmation that the red-shift
is not exhibit of the inﬂation of the universe.
