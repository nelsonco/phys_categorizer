Abstract

±

54 km/s, which is in excellent agreement with the speed of v = 365

We report a simple re-analysis of the old results (1887) from the Michelson-Morley interfer-
ometer experiment that was designed to detect absolute motion. We build upon a recent (1998)
re-analysis of the original data by M´unera, which revealed a small but signiﬁcant eﬀect after al-
lowing for several systematic errors in the original analysis. The further re-analysis here reveals
that a genuine eﬀect of absolute motion is expected, in what is essentially a quantum interference
experiment, but only if the photons travel in the interferometer at speeds V < c. This is the
case if the interferometer operates in a dielectric, such as air, as was the case, incidently, of
the Michelson-Morley experiment. The re-analysis here of the Michelson-Morley experimental
data, correcting for the refractive index eﬀect of the air, reveals an absolute speed of the Earth of
18 km/s determined
v = 359
from the dipole ﬁt, in 1991, to the NASA COBE satellite Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR)
observations. Other experiments where the interferometers operated in air (Miller 1925,1933)
or helium (Illingworth 1927) give similar results when re-analysed. These experimental results
refute Einstein’s assertion that absolute motion through space has no meaning. This re-analysis
was motivated by developments in a new information-theoretic modelling of reality, known as
Process Physics1, in which the Einstein Special and General Relativity formalisms arise as con-
sequences of an emergent quantum-foam explanation for space. This amounts to an absolute and
preferred frame of reference, in what is a uniﬁed quantum theory of space, gravity and matter.
So Einstein’s theoretical phenomenology survives, and is now explained, even though he used
a false premise in his derivation, but his spacetime construct is now seen to have no ontologi-
cal signiﬁcance. We predict that new interferometer experiments, operating in dielectric mode,
will reveal an inward velocity component of magnitude 11.2km/s due to the quantum-foam ﬂow
caused by the matter of the Earth. This is a fundamental test of the quantum theory of gravity
that has emerged from Process Physics.

One key unchallenged folklore in physics is that the Michelson interferometer laboratory ex-
periment of 1881 [1], and repeated by Michelson and Morley in 1987 [2], that were designed to
detect absolute motion, gave a null result, vindicating Einstein’s assumption that absolute motion
(motion relative to space itself) has no meaning; it is in principle not detectable in a laboratory
situation. Motion of objects is always relative to other objects, according to Einstein. Using this
assumption Einstein went on to construct the Special and General Theory of Relativity, which uses
the notion of spacetime to avoid any notion of absolute space. Of course Einstein’s formalism has
been abundantly conﬁrmed both by the extensive use of the special theory in particle physics exper-
iments and theory, and by the general theory in various experimental and observational situations.
Nevertheless we report here experimental evidence that absolute motion is detectable in laboratory
experiments, such as those done by Michelson and Morley and others, but that this requires a
re-analysis of the operation of their interferometer, as reported herein. This analysis leads to a
speed which agrees with that found from the NASA COBE satellite observations on analysing the
dipole anisotropy of the Cosmic Background Radiation. These two speed observations, 104 years
apart, agree within experimental errors. Together these results show that absolute motion has been
detected. New interferometer experiments are needed to conﬁrm that the direction of that motion
is the same as the direction discovered by the COBE mission. These results are profoundly signiﬁ-
cant to our understanding of reality. It follows from recent work that these experimental outcomes
will not be in conﬂict with the Einstein phenomenology, but require a major re-assessment of what
that phenomenology describes [3].

Recent developments in the new information-theoretic modelling of reality, known as Process
Physics [3, 4], indicate that the Einstein Special and General Relativity formalisms arise as a
consequence of an emergent quantum-foam explanation for space, but with this quantum foam
amounting to an absolute and preferred frame of reference, in what is a uniﬁed quantum theory
of space, gravity and matter. In [3] it was shown how the general theory account of gravity arises
from an amalgam of two distinct quantum foam eﬀects, one being the eﬀective diﬀusion of the
quantum foam towards ‘matter’ that acts as a ‘sink’, together with the classical measurement
protocol based on the apparent invariance of the speed of light, which uses the radar method
to retrospectively assign spacetime coordinates to distant events, that is, spacetime is in fact
a historical record of reality, and not reality itself. Here the invariance of the speed of light
is caused by the genuine dynamical eﬀect of the quantum foam on moving rods and clocks, as
suggested long ago by Fitzgerald and Lorentz to explain the, here now disputed, null result of the
Michelson-Morley experiment. Observers adopting this phenomenological property of light within
the classical measurement protocol will ﬁnd, according to Process Physics, that the formalism of the
General Theory of Relativity describes their historical records which have the form of a spacetime
geometrical construct, but that this spacetime construct has no ontological signiﬁcance. In this
construct the modelling of time by geometry is entirely appropriate; it is essentially a pagination
of the historical record. The resolution of the confusion between the geometrical modelling of time
in historical records and time as an actual process has now been achieved within the new Process
Physics. The older but still current Non-Process Physics modelling of reality, which has been with
us since Galileo and Newton introduced the geometrical modelling of time, is now superseded.

An implication of these developments in Process Physics is that it should be possible in prin-
ciple to overcome the classical measurement protocol eﬀects by using the long-known nonlocality
of quantum processes which should be sensitive to absolute motion through this quantum foam.
Indeed ever since the Aspect [5] experiment showed a violation of the Bell inequalities, in the con-
text of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) nonlocal eﬀects it has been understood that quantum

2

collapse events caused by quantum detectors appear to require a preferred frame, and so appear
to be in conﬂict with Einstein’s assumption. The work of Hardy [6] and Percival [7] suggested
that ‘double-EPR’ experiments could reveal an absolute frame, and hence absolute motion, though
such experiments for this purpose would be extremely diﬃcult. However the old Michelson-Morley
interferometer experiment is actually a quantum interferometer, that is, in principle it could be
done with one photon at a time, and we inquired why it is believed that it was unable to detect a
preferred frame, and so absolute motion. In fact it can do so.

As described in Fig.1 the beamsplitter/mirror A sends a photon ψ(t) into a superposition
ψ(t) = ψ1(t) + ψ2(t), with each component travelling in diﬀerent arms of the interferometer, until
they are recombined in the quantum detector which results in a localisation process, and one spot
in the detector is produced. Repeating with many photons, reveals that the interference between
ψ1 and ψ2 at the detector results in fringes. Before the quantum theory (and in particular before
the new quantum foam physics) Michelson designed the interferometer with the idea that any
motion through absolute space (then called the luminiferous aether) would result in diﬀerent path
lengths for light waves in the two arms, which would show as a shift in the fringe. Of course as
an experimental expediency one rotates the apparatus through 90o so that the roles of the two
arms are interchanged, this rotation then should result in a shift of the fringes, which is an eﬀect
more easily observed. However Michelson and Morley reported a null result, despite a small eﬀect
actually being seen. Fitzgerald and then Lorentz then oﬀered an explanation for the null result,
namely that the failure to get an eﬀect was caused by the actual contraction of the arm moving
lengthwise through the absolute space, as we show below. However long ago it was decided by
physicists that the more elaborate Einstein explanation in terms of spacetime transformations was
superior to this dynamical explanation.

In reviewing the operation of the Michelson-Morley interferometer (see below) it was noticed
that the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction explanation only implies a null eﬀect if the experiment
is performed in vacuum.
In air, in which photons travel slightly slower than in vacuum, there
should be a small fringe shift eﬀect when the apparatus is rotated, even after taking account of the
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction. This appears to have gone unnoticed. As well M´unera [8] in 1998
has corrected the original results for various systematic errors, and shown that these interferometer
experiments do indeed reveal small but signiﬁcant non-null results, but as expected now, only when
they are operated in a dielectric.

We have applied the elementary correction required for the eﬀects of the air, or in one case
helium, to various interferometer results as corrected by M´unera for other systematic errors. The
correction is in fact large, being some two orders of magnitude. Applied to one set of data the
54 km/s. Even more amazing is
Michelson-Morley experiment now results in a speed of v = 359
±
the excellent agreement of this speed with the speed of v = 365
18 km/s determined from the
dipole ﬁt, in 1991, to the NASA COBE satellite Cosmic Background Radiation observations [9].

±

We now indicate the proper understanding of the operation of the Michelson-Morley interfer-
ometers when operated in a dielectric, and then report the corrected results, as shown in Fig.2.
The two arms are constructed to have the same lengths when they are physically parallel to each
other. For convenience assume that the value L of this length refers to the lengths when at rest in
the quantum foam. The Fitzgerald-Lorentz eﬀect is that the arm AB parallel to the direction of
motion is shortened to

Figure 1: Schematic diagrams of the Micheslon Interferometer, with beamsplitter/mirror at A and mirrors
at B and C, on equal length arms when parallel, from A. D is a quantum detector (not drawn in (b))
that causes localisation of the photon state by a collapse process. In (a) the interferometer is at rest in
the quantum foam. In (b) the interferometer is moving with speed v relative to the quantum foam in the
direction indicated. Interference fringes are observed at the quantum detector D. If the interferometer is
rotated in the plane through 90o, the roles of arms AC and AB are interchanged, and during the rotation
shifts of the fringes are seen in the case of absolute motion, but only if the apparatus operates in a dielectric.
By counting fringe changes the speed v may be determined.

Following Fig.(1), we consider the case when the apparatus is moving at speed v through the
quantum foam, and that the photon states travel at speed V = c/n relative to the quantum foam,
where n is the refractive index of the gas and c is the speed of light, in vacuum, relative to the
A be
quantum foam. Let the time taken for ψ1 to travel from A
tBA. In moving from the beamsplitter at A to B, the photon state ψ1 must travel an extra distance
because the mirror B travels a distance vtAB in this time, thus the total distance that must be
traversed is

Similarly, on returning from B to A, the photon state ψ1 must travel the distance

Hence the total time tABA taken for ψ1 to travel from A

Now trivially ∆t = 0 if v = 0, but also ∆t = 0 when v
= 0 but only if V = c. This then would
result in a null result on rotating the apparatus. Hence the null result of the Michelson-Morley
apparatus is only for the special case of photons travelling in vacuum for which V = c, as conﬁrmed
by the modern vacuum interferometer experiment of Brillet and Hall [10], which in-eﬀect conﬁrms
(1). However if the apparatus is immersed in a gas then V < c and a non-null eﬀect is expected on
= 0. It is essential then in analysing data to correct for this

The value of ∆t is deduced from analysing the fringe shifts, and then the speed vM M (in previous
Michelson-Morley analyses) has been extracted using (13), instead of the correct form (11). ∆t is
typically of order 10−15s. However it is very easy to correct for this oversight. From (11) and (13)
we obtain, for the corrected absolute speed through the quantum-foam vQF ,

Note that for air at STP n = 1.00029, while for helium at STP n = 1.000036, and so the correction
factor of 1/√n
1 is large. The corrected speeds vQF for four MM experiments are shown in Fig.2,
and compared with the CBR speed determined from the COBE data [9].

M´unera [8] has reviewed these interferometer experiments and uncovered systematic errors and
as well applied standard statistical tests to the values originally reported. He has noted that the
Michelson-Morley experiments and subsequent repetitions never were null, and that correcting
for invalid inter-session averaging leads to even larger non null results. M´unera’s new results are
as follows. The original Michelson-Morley data [2] now gives vM M = 6.22km/s with a standard
deviation on the mean of 0.93km/s for one set of noon sessions, while giving vM M = 6.80km/s with
a standard deviation on the mean of 2.49km/s for 18h observations. For Miller [11, 12], from results
at Mt Wilson after moving the Morley-Miller [13] experiment, the new result is vM M = 8.22km/s
with an upperbound at 95% CL of vM M = 9.61km/s and a lower bound at 95% CL of vM M =
6.83km/s. The Illingworth [14] data (from a helium-ﬁlled inteferometer) gives smaller values of

5

6
6
vM M = 3.13km/s with an upperbound at 95% CL of vM M = 4.17km/s and a lower bound at 95%
CL of vM M = 2.09km/s.

Hence the Michelson-Morley and Miller values for vM M appear to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the
value from Illingworth. But this is now an expected outcome as Illingworth used helium (to control
temperature variations) instead of air. Because of the diﬀerent refractive indices of air and helium
the correction factors are substantially diﬀerent (1/√n
1 = 58.7 for air at STP and = 166.7 for
helium at STP), and as shown in Fig.2 the air and helium ﬁlled interferometers now give comparable
results, when corrected. The use of helium by Illingworth has turned out to be a fortuitous situation
that allows us to conﬁrm the correction-factor dependence on n in (14). We have assumed that
Illingworth used helium at STP, but if in fact he used helium at 2 atmospheres then his corrected
data, in Fig.2, would coincide with the COBE data. We have also used the n value for air at STP
in correcting the Miller results even though the experiments were performed at altitude on Mt.
Wilson.

Morley (noon observations) [2], (2) Michelson-Morley experiments (18h observations) [2], (3) Miller, Mt.
Wilson [11, 12], (4) Illingworth [14], and ﬁnally in (5) the speed from the COBE satellite observation of
the CBR microwave spectrum dipole term [9]. The results (1)-(4) are not corrected for the
30km/s of the
orbital motion of the earth about the sum, though this correction was made, as well as that for the satellite
orbital speed, in the case of (5). The agreement between the Michelson-Morley result in (1) and the COBE
result in (5) is striking. The horizontal line at v = 365km/s is to aid comparisons with the COBE data.

±

Of course the vacuum experiment by Brillet and Hall [10] gave a genuine null outcome as now
expected. The presence of gases in these early experiments, rather than high vacuum, was of course
an experimental expediency, but only because of this can we now realise the full implications of
these long forgotten experiments.

Hence the old interferometer data is not only non-null but the extracted speeds agree, within
errors, with the speed determined from analysis of the CBR dipole component observed by the
COBE mission. These results demonstrate that absolute motion has a meaning and is measureable.
A new class of experiment can now be carried out using say a rotateable ﬁbreoptic laser in-
terferometer, and such quantum-gravity experiments are capable of measuring the absolute speed

6

and direction of motion of the Earth through the quantum foam that is space. As well the very
large gravity-wave laser interferometers could be used in a gas-ﬁlled mode rather than a vacuum
mode and, if suﬃcient temperature control can be achieved, they could be used as absolute motion
detectors. Daily and seasonal changes in vQF will be seen as ~vQF is the vector sum of various con-
tributions due to the eﬀects of the dissipative and non-uniform ﬂows of the quantum foam (which
is gravity, [3]) by the earth, moon and sun, as well as the overall eﬀect of the motion of the Earth
and the solar system through the CBR determined quantum-foam frame of reference which is, it
now turns out, was one of the main discoveries of the COBE mission.

A task for new interferometers would be to establish the in-ward ﬂow rate of the quantum
foam, predicted to be 11.2km/s at the Earth’s surface. This quantum-foam ﬂow is a key test of
the quantum theory of gravity that has emerged from Process Physics [3, 4, 15, 16, 17, 18], and
in which Newton’s gravitational constant G is a measure of the rate at which ‘quantum matter’
dissipates quantum foam.

The signiﬁcance of this new interpretation of the outcomes of the various Michelson-Morley
experiments can hardly be overstated, it will change forever how physicists comprehend reality.
These results undermine Einstein’s assertion that absolute motion has no meaning. This Process
Physics supersedes the prevailing Non-Process Physics modelling of reality, which is characterised
by the geometrical modelling of time. It is remarkable that these experiments were carried out
with such diligence and care so long ago that their data, when now properly analysed, yield speeds
consistent with those found from satellite technology 104 years later, and even more so when we
understand that some of the experimenters themselves believed they had failed to detect non-null
eﬀects.
In eﬀect the Michelson interferometer, operating with dielectric medium, is a quantum
interferometer that performed the ﬁrst quantum gravity experiment as it was capable of detecting
absolute motion through the quantum foam that is space.

Again we emphasis that the Einstein Special and General Relativity is essentially a model of
the potential history of the universe rather than of the universe itself. Clearly if the universe is
lawful, then so is its history, though the ‘laws’ for the latter will clearly be diﬀerent and, as is well
known, they have the form of a diﬀerential geometry - the spacetime construct. But in Process
Physics we see a deeper understanding of reality in which time is not geometry, it is process.
