Full size single-sided GaAs microstrip detectors with integrated coupling
capacitors and bias resistors have been fabricated on 3” substrate wafers.
PECVD deposited SiO2 and SiO2/Si3N4 layers were used to provide cou-
pling capacitaces of 32.5 pF/cm and 61.6 pF/cm, respectively. The resis-
tors are made of sputtered CERMET using simple lift of technique. The
sheet resistivity of 78 kΩ/sq. and the thermal coeﬃcient of resistance of
less than 4×10−3/◦C satisfy the demands of small area biasing resistors,
working on a wide temperature range.

1 Introduction

Several aspects on the design of a semiconductor microstrip detectors has
to be taken into account in order to get a good signal to noise ratio. First
of all, the strip capacitance (the sum of the interstrip capacitances between
neighbouring strips and the body capacitance of the strip) should be low
because it determines the noise level of the readout electronics [1]. For short
shaping times, there is almost no additional contribution due to the shot
noise of the detector. This is still the case for the higher leakage currents of
GaAs detectors (∼20 nA/mm2) [2] compared to standard Si detectors (∼0.5
nA/mm2)[3]. Short shaping times have to be used because of the very high
luminosity (1034 cm−2s−1) and high bunch crossing rate (40 MHz) at future
high energy physics experiments like LHC [4].

Secondly, the interstrip capacitance has to be large compared to the body
(backplane) capacitance of the strip to avoid signal losses to ground.

Thirdly, the coupling capacitance has to be magnitudes higher compared to
the strip capacitance in order to avoid a signal spreading to neighbouring
strips [5].

Biasing resistors are necessary to drain out the leakage current of the detector.
In conjunction with the strip capacitors, they act as a low pass ﬁlters. Values
in the range of MΩ are needed to avoid signal losses to ground.

In addition strip resistance has to be minimized to reduce dispersion of the
signal pulse during penetration at the transmission line of the strip [6].

Due to limited space resources, it is not possible to integrate coupling capaci-
tors and bias resistors on VLSI-ampliﬁer chips. Hence external capacitor and
resistor chips have to be used, or they have to be integrated onto the detec-
tor. On integrated detectors, a reduced number of interconnections have to
be made which improves yield and reliability. On the other hand additional
processing steps raise cost and complexity of detector fabrication.

Simpliﬁcation of processing steps is an essential task in detector design. One
of the major advantages of GaAs detectors is the fact that simple Schottky
contacts can be used instead of diﬀused or implanted pn-contacts in silicon
technology. No intermediate p-stops are needed to compensate accumulated
surface charge between n-strips. Although GaAs substrate wafers are more
expensive than Si wafers, a reduced number of masks and processing steps
makes GaAs microstrip detectors competitive to standard Si-detectors.

The design, fabrication and electrical performance of integrated GaAs-microstrip
detectors are described in the following sections.

2 Wafer design

The wafer design contains several detectors and test structures. In accordance
to the SCT96 layout speciﬁcation of the ATLAS detector at LHC [7], a key-
stone detector was designed which covers the main part of the wafer. The 6
cm long detector with 256 strips has a tilt angle of 3◦ and a varying pitch
from 80 µm at the top to 68 µm at the bottom of the strips. The gap between
the strips is constantly 25 µm. At the bottom, each strip is connectet via a
biasing resistor to the common bias bar.

In addition, four detectors with a reduced lenght of 1.5 cm, 50 µm pitch and
256 strips were placed on the wafer design. Two of them are detectors with

2

a variable width of the strips (40/30/25/20 µm) which are grouped in 64
strips each. All detectors are AC-coupled. The detectors are surrounded with
some test structures to measure the performance of the biasing resistors and
coupling capacitances.

The mask set consists of six layers. The ﬁrst one deﬁnes the strips, guard
ring, bond pads and biasing line of the detector. The second mask opens the
contact windows for the bond pads and the resistors in the dielectric layer.
The third mask is used for the CERMET resistors. The resistor lines lay on
top of the dielectric and are connected to the strips and the common biasing
line via etched holes. The serpentine design was selected because of a better
utilisation of the area. The fourth mask deﬁnes the top strip metallization for
the capacitors and provides vias over the guard ring to the bond pads at the
ﬁrst level metallization. Mask ﬁve and six deﬁne the backside metallization of
the wafer and opens contact holes in the backside passivation.

Fig.1 shows the integrated CERMET resistors at the end of a 50 µm pitch
microstrip detector. The strips are surrounded by a guard ring.

3 Device fabrication

All detectors have been designed and fabricated in our laboratory at the Ma-
terials Research Center in Freiburg. Detectors and test structures of various
geometries were processed on 3 in. semi insulating GaAs from Freiberger Com-
pound Materials. Before deposition of the contacts, wafers were cleaned in ace-
tone and iso-propanol with a subsequent etch in HCl/H2O and NH4OH/H2O2/H20.
Either Ti/Pt/Au/Ni (10/20/80/5 nm) or Ti/Ti-W/Al/Ti-W (10/10/100/5
nm) layers were used as ﬁrst level metallization. Depending on the barrier
layer, the Schottky contacts are stable up to process temperatures between
400 ◦C an 500 ◦C. RBS measurements have shown that the sputtered Ti-W
barrier layer exhibits a better performance with respect to the temperature
stability of the Schottky contact. In either case thermal budget is a critical
point during detector fabrication. The strip resistance was in the range be-
tween 150 Ω/cm and 200 Ω/cm for 30 µm wide Strips.

Single layers of SiO2 or double layers of SiO2/Si3N4 were deposited at 300◦C
in a PECVD process. Afterwards contact holes were etched into the dielectric
layers to provide interconnections to the resistors and the second level metal-
lization (see Fig. 2). The etch mask was also used for a Ni/Au/Ni (10/90/10
nm) plug ﬁll of the contact holes. In the next step, CERMET was sputtered
onto the wafer to deﬁne the resistors after the lift oﬀ process. Then, the second
level metallization was deposited using either evaporated Ni/Au (10/100 nm)
layers or sputtered Al (120 nm) to provide the coupling capacitors.

3

Next, the front side was covered with photoresist to protect the surface and
the originally 625 µm thick wafers were lapped and polished down in a CMP
process to a residual thickness of 200 µm. The backside of the wafers were
O-implanted at an energy of 130 keV with a dose of 1 × 1013 cm−2. The re-
sulting damage induced isolation layer improves the breakdown behavior at
full depletion [8]. Afterwards, the backside was patterned photolithographi-
cally in a double sided mask aligner to deﬁne the backside contact under the
strips. Sputtered Ti-W/Al (10/120 nm) was used as metallization. Finally a
layer of PECVD SiO2 was deposited and etched to protect the backside from
scratches during handling and mounting of the detectors.

4 Interstrip capacitance

Variation of the interstrip capacitance with the gap was measured at the vari-
able width detector. As expected, the interstrip capacitance is a decreasing
function with the separation of the strips. As shown in Fig.3, the interstrip
capacitance to the ﬁrst neighbour strip varies between 1.15 pF/cm at 10 µm
separation down to 0.67 pF/cm for a gap of 30 µm. The interstrip capacitance
to the second neighbour strip is about 60 % of this. Hence a total strip capac-
itance in the range between 2.5 pF/cm and 4.5 pF/cm could be expected for
the considered detector geometries. Demanding a ten times higher coupling
capacitance, the coupling capacitance should be in the range between 150 pF
and 270 pF for 6 cm long strips.

5 Coupling capacitors

Because of the poor electric properties of native GaAs oxides (As2O3, Ga2O3),
foreign dielectric materials have to be used in GaAs device processing. Mate-
rials available for dielectric layers in microelectronics are usually SiO2, Si3N4,
Al2O3, Ta2O5 and Polyimide [9]. All of those materials are showing some
strengths and weaknesses.

Depending on the deposition technique and conditions the dielectric constant
is between 4 and 5 for SiO2 and between 6 and 9 for Si3N4. Usually they
are deposited in a PECVD process at relatively low temperatures (300 ◦C).
Both layers are easily wet etchable in buﬀered HF to open contact windows. A
combination of both layers are often preferred because of the lower breakdown
voltage due to pinholes formation in SiO2 and the high intrinsic stress of Si3N4
when single layers are used [10].

Polyimide can be easily spun onto surfaces like a photoresist but require high

4

curing temperatures ( > 400 ◦C) to achieve best dielectric properties. Dielectric
constant is in the range between 3 and 4. Film thickness is hard to control
and patterning has to be done using dry etching in an oxygen plasma [9].

Al2O3 and Ta2O5 have high dielectric constants of 9.5 and more than 20, re-
spectively. Sputtering methods can be used for deposition but surface damage
and variation of ﬁlm thickness can be signiﬁcant[11].

Within this work, the materials of choice were single layers of SiO2 (300 nm)
and double layers of SiO2/Si3N4 (100 nm/200 nm) deposited in a PECVD
process. Some results are presented in the following section.

5.1 Measurements

All measurements have been performed on wafer at a probe station using a
HP 4284 A LCR-meter in parallel mode. Fixed frequency measurements were
done at 10 kHz with a oscillating level of 200 mV and a DC-bias voltage of 2
V in accordance to the expected voltage drop at the biasing resistors.

A comparison between the diﬀerent dielectric layers is shown in Fig. 4 for a
detector with variable strip length and in Fig. 5 for a detector with variable
strip width. The calculated dielectric constants for SiO2 and SiO2/Si3N4 are
4.0 and 7.3, respectively. For a strip width of 35 mm, the measured coupling
capacitances were 23.0 ± 0.2 pF/cm and 42.0 ± 0.5 pF/cm, respectively. The
full size keystone detector with 80 µm pitch, constant gap of 20 µm, constant
length of 6 cm and varying width from top to bottom of the strip had a
coupling capacitance of 200 pF for SiO2 and 370 pF for SiO2/Si3N4.

As plotted in Fig. 6, the coupling capacitance is frequency independent over
a wide range. At frequencies above 100 kHz a signiﬁcant decrease is observed
for the full size keystone detector. This is due to the fact, that the coupling
capacitors have to be treated as a distributed transmission line of ﬁnite resis-
tors and capacitors[6]. At high frequencies, the eﬀective length of the capacitor
is reduced, resulting in a lower capacitance. This is especially the case when
implanted strips in Si-detectors have a high resistivity and were not covered
with a metallization layer [1]. For the GaAs detector of shorter lengths and
smaller resistances, this eﬀect is negligible.

6 Biasing resistors

Using lift-oﬀ technique, ﬁlm thickness is normally restricted to less than 200
nm. In width, the resistor area is restricted by the pitch of the strips. The

5

length should be as small as possible because it acts as a dead part of the
detector. On the other hand, structures become more sensitive to varying
deposition conditions if the dimensions are to small. A suitable compromise
is a resistor area in the rage of 50 µm × 250 µm. Hence the sheet resistivity
of the resistor material must be in the range of 50 - 100 kΩ/sq. to achieve
resistor values in the MΩ range.

Microstrip detectors in the ATLAS-experiment at LHC has to operate at a
temperature of -10 ◦C for a period of at least 10 years. Therefore it is recom-
mended that the resistor material has a low temperature coeﬃcient..

The requirements of a high sheet resistance, long term stability and weak
temperature dependence limits the suitable alternatives for resistor materials.
Diﬀerent approaches have been evaluated to integrate biasing structures on
microstrip detectors so far. This includes passive components like polysilicon
resistors [12] as well as active devices like punch-through biasing [13] and
FOXFET structures[14].

Polysilicon has to be deposited at rather high temperatures in a LPCVD pro-
cess and local implantation steps with post annealing at high temperature has
to be applied to get a good ohmic junction at the metal strip/polysilicon inter-
face [15]. Moreover, if pure Al is used as strip metallization, spiking problems
could degrade reliability of the resistors.

Punch-through biasing needs no extra processing steps but suﬀers from a
leakage current dependent dynamic resistance which causes considerable base
line diﬀerences between channels.

On the FOXFET-structure, a gate electrode covering the punch-through gap
controls the dynamic resistance. Unfortunately no integration of FOXFET-
structures on GaAs detectors is possible because of the well known pinning of
the Fermi level to the middle of the band gap at the dielectric/GaAs interface
[16]

This work is focussed on a new type of biasing resistors for microstrip detectors
which will be discussed in the following section.

6.1 Integrated CERMET-resistors

Thin ﬁlm resistors made of CERMET have been widely used in microelectronic
industry for a long time [17] - [21]. CERMET (CERamic/METal) is a mixture
of an insulator (SiO) and a metal (Cr or Au). In this two phase material current
transport is interpreted in terms of electron tunneling between metal islands
in the insulator matrix [22]. Simultaneously evaporation [23] or sputtering [24]

6

can be used for deposition.

It was found, that the electrical properties are very sensitive to the CERMET
composition and the deposition conditions (substrate temperature, sputtering
power, post annealing)[24,21]. Reducing the Cr content in the sputtering target
from 50 % to 10 % by volume results in a drastic increase in sheet resistance
from 103 Ω/sq. to 1013 Ω/sq. Hence a wide range of resistor values can be
obtained by choosing appropriate target composition.

6.2 Measurement

A target composition of 55 Vol. % SiO / 45 Vol. % Cr was chosen in order to
reach the mentioned demands on the sheet resistivity. Rf-magnetron sputtering
in DC mode have been performed in a sputtering system from von Ardenne
(LA250).

Fig. 7 shows the I-V characteristics of the integrated CERMET biasing re-
sistors for two diﬀerent sputtering powers. In order to achieve a comparable
resistor thickness, the sputtering time has to be increased form 100 seconds
at 200 Watt to 250 seconds at 100 Watt because of lower deposition rates at
reduced power. Adhesion of the CERMET ﬁlm was found to be excellent in
any case. The ﬁnal thicknesses were measured with a stylus proﬁler (Tencor
P10) giving values of 133 µm and 121 µm for 200 W and 100 W, respectively.
From the slope of the I-V curve, the resistance was calculated to be 4.85 MΩ
at 200 W and 2.47 MΩ at 100 W sputtering power.

Some test vehicles were used to measure the resistance as a function of resistor
length. The width of the resistor line was 10 µm. The corresponding resistivity
was calculated to be 0.95 Ωcm and 3.14 Ωcm for 100 W and 200 W sputtering
power, respectively. This corresponds to a sheet resistance of 78.4 kΩ/sq. and
236 kΩ/sq., respectively.

In steps of 5 K, I-V curves as a function of temperature between -40 ◦C and
+60 ◦C were measured in a temperature controlled chamber. The temperature
behavior is described by the thermal coeﬃcient of resistance (TCR), which is
deﬁned as:

The TCR α can be calculated from the relative change of resistance ∆R/R
due to a temperature change ∆T . A comparison of the TCR between the

α =

∆R
R ∗ ∆T

integrated CERMET resistors and a external resistor chip 1 is shown in Fig.8.
External R-chips are frequently used, if no biasing resistors are integrated on
the detector. In both cases the TCR is negative and smoothly increasing with
temperature. For the CERMET resistors a value of -4 × 10−3/◦C at -10 ◦C
reaching -2.5 × 10−3/◦C at room temperature was calculated. Those TCR
values are even lower than the corresponding values for the external resistors
and show the good performance of the CERMET.

Deposition Parameters and resulting resistor values are summarized in Table
1.

6.2.1 Homogeneity and yield

The homogeneity of the CERMET resistors over a 256 strip detector is shown
in Fig. 9. Every 10th resistor was measured on a needle probe station. Non
of them exhibited a mal-function due to broken resistor lines or insuﬃcient
contact performance. Obviously there is a left-right increase in the resistor
value with a small oscillation. So far it is not clear, whether this comes from
the magnetron sputtering proﬁle or a varying composition in the target. The
average value was (2.98 ± 0.17) MΩ.

7 Conclusions

A six mask process for fabricating AC-coupled GaAs microstrip detectors with
a new type of integrated biasing resistors was developed. Process temperatures
do not exceed 300◦C in order to risk a degeneration of the Schottky contacts.

Coupling capacitances with diﬀerent dielectric layers have been integrated
onto microstrip detectors. For full size keystone detectors of 6 cm length and
80 µm pitch, the corresponding values of the coupling capacitance were 200 pF
and 370 pF for SiO2 and SiO2/Si3N4, respectively. The frequency dependence
of the integrated capacitors is almost as good as an external C-chip. Only a
weak decrease of the capacitance above 100 kHz was observed.

The measurements have shown that the electrical properties of the 2.47 MΩ
CERMET resistors are quite reasonable and meet the basic requirements. The
sheet resistance of the 121 nm thick rf-sputtered layer at 100 W sputtering
power is 78.4 kΩ/sq.. It can be varied by the sputtering power. The TCR of
2.5 × 10−3/◦C is comparable to that of an external R-Chip that is frequently
used for nonintegrated microstrip detectors.

It has to be proofed, if the high strip resistance of 150 Ω/cm signiﬁcant dete-
riorates the signal to noise level when ampliﬁers with fast shaping times are
used. The recently fabricated detectors are currently being tested with respect
to their charge collection eﬃciency and position resolution.
