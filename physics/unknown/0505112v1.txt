Abstract: In mix-game which is an extension of minority game, there are two groups of agents; group1 

plays the majority game, but the group2 plays the minority game. This paper studies the change of the 

average winnings of agents and volatilities vs. the change of mixture of agents in mix-game 

model. It finds that the correlations between the average winnings of agents and the mean of 

local volatilities  are  different  with  different combinations of agent memory length when the 

proportion  of  agents  in  group  1  increases.  This study  result  suggests  that  memory  length  of 

agents  in  group1  be  smaller  than  that  of  agent  in  group2  when  mix-game  model  is  used  to 

simulate the financial markets.

1.  Introduction:   

Challet and Zhang's MG model, together with the original bar model of Arthur [1], attracts 

a lot of following studies. Given the MG's richness and yet underlying simplicity, the MG has 

also  received  much  attention  as  a  financial  market  model  [2].  The  MG  comprises  an  odd 

number  of  agents  choosing  repeatedly  between  the  options  of  buying  (1)  and  selling  (0)  a 

quantity  of  a  risky  asset.  The  agents  continually  try  to  make  the  minority  decision  i.e.  buy 

assets when the majority of other agents are selling and sell when the majority of other agents 

are buying. Neil F. Johnson [3, 4] and coworkers extended MG by allowing a variable number 

of active traders at each timestep--- they called their modified game as the Grand Canonical 

Minority  Game  (GCMG).  The  GCMG,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  basic  MG  itself,  can 

reproduce  the  stylized  facts  of  financial  markets,  such  as  volatility  clustering  and  fat-tail 

distributions. However, there are some weaknesses in MG and GCMG. First, the diversity of 

agents  is  limited,  since  agents  all  have  the  same  memory  and  time-horizon.  Second,  in  real 

markets,  some  agents  are  tendency-followers,  i.e.  “noise  traders”  [5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12], 

who effectively play a majority game; while others are “foundation traders”, who effectively 

play a minority game. 

In order to create an agent-based model which more closely mimics a real financial market, 

I proposed a mix-game model which is a modification of MG [13]. In mix-game model there 

are  two  groups  of  agents:  each  group  has  different  memory  and  time-horizon.  The  most 

important modification is to make one group plays the minority game and the other plays the 

majority  game.  Through  simulations,  I  find  out  that  the  fluctuations  of  local  volatilities 

change a lot by adding some agents who play majority game into MG, but the stylized features 

of  MG  don’t  change  obviously  except  agents  with  memory  length  1  and  2.  I  also  give 

suggestions about how to use mix-game to model financial markets and show the example of 

modeling Shanghai stock market by means of mix-game model [13]. 

In this paper, I further examine the correlations between the average winnings of agents 

and  the  local  volatilities  of  systems  in  mix-game  model  when  the  proportion  of  agents  in 

group1  increases  from  0  to  0.4.  In  section  2,  I  describe  the  mix-game  model  and  the 

simulation  conditions.  In  section  3,  the  simulation  results  and  discussion  are  presented.  In 

section 4, I calculate the quantitative correlations. In section 5, the conclusion is reached.     

2.  Simulation: 

Mix-game model is an extension of minority game (MG), so its structure is similar to MG. 

In mix-game, there are two groups of agents; group1 plays the majority game, and the group2 

plays the minority game. N (odd number) is the total number of the agents and N1 is number 

of agents in group1. The system resource is r = N*L, where L<1 is the proportion of resource 

of the system. All agents compete in the system for the limited resource r. T1 and T2 are the 

time horizon lengths of the two groups, and m1 and m2 denote the memory lengths of the two 

groups, respectively.     

The global information only available to the agents is a common bit-string “memory” of the 

m1 or m2 most recent competition outcomes (1 or 0). A strategy consists of a response, i.e., 0 

(sell) or 1 (buy), to each possible bit string; hence there are 

m

122

or 

m

222

  possible strategies 

for group1 or group2, respectively, which form full strategy spaces (FSS). At the beginning of 

the game, each agent is assigned s strategies and keeps them unchangeable during the game. 

After each turn, agents assign one (virtual) point to a strategy which would have predicted the 

correct outcome. For agents in group1, they will reward their strategies one point if they are in 

the majority; for agents in group2, they will reward their strategies one point if they are in the 

minority. Agents collect the virtual points for their strategies over the time horizon T1 or T2, 

and they use their strategies which has the highest virtual point in each turn. If there are two 

strategies which have the highest virtual point, agents use coin toss to decide which strategy 

to be used. Excess demand is equal to the number of ones (buy) which agents choose minus 

the number of zeros (sell) which agents choose. According to a widely accepted assumption 

that  excess  demand  exerts  a  force  on  the  price  of  the  asset  and  the  change  of  price  is 

proportion to the excess demand in a financial market [14, 15, 16], the time series of price of 

the asset can be calculated based on the time series of excess demand.   

In  simulation,  the  distribution  of  initial  strategies  of  agents  is  randomly  distributed  and 

keeps  unchanged  during  the  games.  Simulation  turns  are  3000.  The  window  length  of  local 

volatility is 5. Total number of agents is 201. Number of strategies per agent is 2.

Fig.1  means  of  local  volatilities  vs.  different  N1/N,  Vol.1  representing  mean  of  local  volatilities  of

representing mean of local volatilities of m1=3, m2=6, T1=12, T2=60.   

Fig.1  shows  that  means  of  local  volatilities  (Vol.1  and  Vol.2)  decrease  while  N1/N 

increases  from  0  to  0.4  under  condition  of  m1=m2=6,  T1=T2=60  and  condition  of  m1=6, 

m2=3,  T1=60,  T2=12.  But  under  condition  of  m1=3,  m2=6,  T1=12,  T2=60,  mean  of  local 

volatilities (Vol.3) has a minimum value at N1/N=0.2.

Fig.2 average winnings per agent per turn for mix-game vs. different proportion of agents in group1 when 

m1=m2=6, T1=T2=60; R1 represents the average winning per agent per turn of group1, and R2 represents 

the average winning per agent per turn of group2. 

From  Fig.  2,  one  can  find  that  the  average  winnings  (R1  and  R2)  of  these  two  groups 

increase when N1/N is larger than 0.1 and the average winning of group 1 is larger than that 

of group 2. Agents in both groups benefit from the increase of the number of agents in group1. 

Comparing Fig.2 with Fig.1, one can find that the mean of local volatilities (Vol.1) decreases 

accompanying  with  the  increase  of  the  average  winnings  of  group1  and  group2  (R1,  R2) 

while N1/N increases from 0 to 0.4 under the condition of m1=m2=6, T1=T2=60. This means 

that the improvement of the efficiency of systems is accordant with the improvement of the 

performance of individual agents under this simulation condition. This result shows that both 

the  efficiency  of  systems  and  the  performance  of  individual  agents  increase  while  the 

proportion  of  agents  in  group  1  increases.  Similar  phenomena  can  be  found  in  ecological 

systems, computing systems and economic systems in which agents (species, computing tasks 

and  firms)  having  different  niches  will  improve  the  efficiencies  of  systems  and  their  own 

performance [17].

From  Fig.  3,  one  can  find  that  the  average  winnings  (R1  and  R2)  of  these  two  groups 

don’t  change  obviously  when  N1/N  increases  from  0  to  0.4,  except  R1  at  N1/N=0.1.  The 

average  winnings  of  group  1  are  larger  than  those  of  group  2.  Comparing  Fig.3  with  Fig.1, 

one can find that the mean of local volatilities (Vol.2) decreases while N1/N increases from 0 

to  0.4  under  the  condition  of  m1=6,  m2=3,  T1=60,  T2=12,  but  the  change  of  the  average 

winnings of group1 and group2 (R1, R2) seems more complicated than that in Fig.2.

m1=3, m2=6, T1=12, T2=60. R1, R2 have the same meaning as that indicated in Fig.2. 

From  Fig.  4,  one  can  find  that  the  average  winnings  (R1  and  R2)  of  these  two  groups 

increase  obviously  when  N1/N  increases  from  0  to  0.4  and  the  average  winning  of  group  1 

(R1) is larger than that of group 2 (R2). Agents in both groups benefit from the increase of the 

number of agents in group1. Comparing Fig.4 with Fig.1, one can find that the mean of local 

volatilities (Vol.3) decreases slightly when N1/N increase from 0 to 0.2, then it increase while 

N1/N  increases  from  0.2  to  0.4  under  the  condition  of  m1=3,  m2=6,  T1=12,  T2=60, 

accompanying with the increase of the average winnings of group1 and group2 (R1, R2). This 

means  that  the  improvement  of  the  performance  of  individual  agents  accompanies  with  the 

decrease  of  the  system  efficiency  under  this  simulation  condition.  Agents  can  make  profits 

from  the  larger  fluctuation  of  systems,  which  is  accordant  with  the  reality  of  financial 

markets.   

For example, the combinations of parameters in this simulation include the configuration of 

parameters  which  is  used  to  model  the  Shanghai  Index  [13].  For  Shanghai  Index,  there  are 

two suitable configurations of parameters: m1=3, T1=12, m2=6, T2=60, N1=40, N=201 and 

m1=4,  m2=6,  T1=T2=12,  N=201,  N1=72,  respectively.  Fig.5  shows  the  log-log  plot  of 

Shanghai-daily  absolute  returns  and  Fig.6  shows  the  log-log  plot  of  mix-game  absolute 

returns of parameters of m1=3, T1=12, m2=6, T2=60, N1=40, N=201, s=2. These two figures 

look  very  similar.  This  implies  that  we  need  to  make  m1  smaller  than  m2  when  we  mimic 

financial markets by means of mix-game model.

Table 3 correlations of R1, R1 and Vol.3 under the condition of m1=3, m2=6, T1=12, T2=60, 

Table 1, 2 and 3 give the quantitative results of correlations among R1, R2 and the means of 

local  volatilities  under  these  three  configurations  of  parameters.  The  results  in  table  1  and 

table 3 are accordant with the qualitative analysis in section 3 and show that the correlations 

between R1 and R2 in both situations are positive. Table 2 gives a clearer picture about the 

correlations among R1, R2 and Vol.3 under the condition of m1=3, m2=6, T1=12, T2=60; the 

correlation between R1 and R2 is negative; the correlation between R1 and Vol.3 is positive 

while the correlation between R2 and Vol.3 is negative. 

5.  Conclusion 

  The  correlations  between  the  average  winnings  of  agents  (R1  and  R2)  and  the  mean  of 

local volatilities are different with different combinations of m1 and m2 when the proportion 

of  agents  in  group  1  increases:  the  correlations  are  negative  with  parameters  of  m1=m2=6, 

T1=T2=60, N=201 and s=2; under the condition of m1=6, m2=3, T1=60, T2=12, N=201 and 

s=2,  the  correlation  of  variable  pair  (R1  and  Vol.2)  is  negative  while  the  correlation  of 

variable pair (R2 and Vol.2) is positive; the correlations are positive with parameters of m1=3, 

m2=6, T1=12, T2=60, N=201 and s=2. 

This  study  result  suggests  that  m1  be  smaller  than  m2  when  mix-game  model  is  used  to 

simulate the financial markets.
