We  describe  experimental  investigations  on  an  optical  frequency  standard  based  on  a 
laser cooled  171Yb+ ion confined in a radiofrequency Paul trap. The electric-quadrupole 
transition  from  the  2S1/2(F=0)  ground  state  to  the  2D3/2(F=2)  state  at  the  wavelength  of 
436 nm  is  used  as  the  reference  transition.  The  reference  transition  is  probed  by  a 
frequency-doubled,  frequency-stabilized  diode  laser  and  is  resolved  with  a  Fourier-
limited full halfwidth of approximately 30 Hz. In order to compare two 171Yb+ standards,  
separate frequency shift and servo systems are employed to stabilise the probe frequency 
to  the  reference  transition  line  centers  of  two  independently  stored  171Yb+  ions.  The 
present  experimental  results  indicate  a  relative  instability  (Allan  standard  deviation) of 
the optical frequency difference between the two systems of s y(1000 s)=1.0(cid:215) 10-15 and a 
mean frequency difference of 0.2 Hz.  Shifts in the range of several Hertz are observed in 
the  frequency  difference  if  a  stationary  electric  field  gradient  is  superimposed  on  the 
radiofrequency trap field. This measurement permits a first experimental estimate of the 
electric quadrupole moment of the 2D3/2 state of Yb+.

Introduction 

171Yb+  is  an  attractive  candidate  for  optical  frequency  standards  based  on  a 
trapped,  laser-cooled  single  ion  because  reference  transitions  with  vanishing 
low-field  linear  Zeeman  frequency  shift  are  available  in  a  level  system  with 
relatively  simple  hyperfine  and  magnetic  sublevel  structure  [1,2].  The  electric-
quadrupole  transition  2S1/2(F=0)  -  2D3/2(F=2)  of  171Yb+  is  at  a  wavelength  of 
436 nm and has a natural linewidth of 3.1 Hz. The absolute optical frequency of 
 fractional uncertainty of 1(cid:215) 10-14, so 
this transition was measured with a total 1s
that it is now one of the most accurately known atomic transition frequencies in 
the optical wavelength range [3,4]. 

 Here we present experimental results on the high-resolution spectroscopy of 
the 436 nm reference transition of 171Yb+, and initial results on the comparison of 
two 171Yb+ optical frequency standards. With respect to the statistical uncertainty 
of the comparison and the ability to resolve small frequency offsets, the results 
yield  an  improvement  by  more  than  one  order  of  magnitude  over  previous 
related  work  [5].  Quadrupole  shifts  of  the  atomic  transition  frequency  of  the 
order  of  a  few  Hertz  which  are  introduced  in  one  trap  by  superimposing  a 
constant  component  on  the  confining  radiofrequency  field  can  be  clearly 
resolved.  This  permits  a  first  experimental  estimate  of  the  electric  quadrupole 
moment of the  2D3/2  state of Yb+. The quadrupole shift caused by electric stray

fields  is  expected  to  be  one  of  the  largest  systematic  frequency  shift  effects  in 
optical  frequency  standards  that  use  ions  with  alkali-like  level  systems  such  as 
171Yb+ and 199Hg+ [6].   

2  Optical-excitation scheme 

A scheme of the lowest-lying energy levels of 171Yb+ is shown in Fig. 1. For laser 
cooling, the low-frequency wing of the quasi-cyclic F=1 - F=0 component of the 
2S1/2  -  2P1/2  resonance  transition  is  excited,  and  a  static  magnetic  field  of 
approximately  300 m T  is  applied  in  order  to  prevent  optical  pumping  to  a 
nonabsorbing  superposition  of  the  magnetic  sublevels  of  the  F=1  ground  state. 
The  natural  linewidth  of  the  resonance  transition  is  21  MHz,  which  implies  a 
one-dimensional  kinetic temperature of 0.6 mK at the Doppler cooling limit. A 
weak  sideband  of  the  cooling radiation provides hyperfine repumping from the 
F=0  ground  state  to  the  2P1/2(F=1)  level. At the end of each cooling phase, the 
hyperfine  repumping  is  switched  off  in  order  to  prepare  the  ion  in  the  F=0 
ground state. 

Fig.  1:  Low-lying  energy  levels  of    171Yb+  and  optical  excitation  scheme.  The  main  spontaneous 
decay paths are indicated by dashed lines. Hyperfine splittings are not drawn to scale. The hyperfine 
splitting frequencies of the S, P, D, and [3/2] levels are respectively given by 12.6 GHz, 2.1 GHz, 
0.9 GHz, and 2.5 GHz. 

The  rapid  spontaneous  decay  from  the  2P1/2  state  to  the  metastable 
2D3/2(F=1) level that occurs during laser cooling is compensated for by coupling 
this  level  to  the  [3/2]1/2(F=1)  state,  from  where  the  ion  readily  returns  to  the 
ground state. The extremely long-lived 2F7/2 state, which is populated at a rate of 
 0.3 h-1, is depleted by excitation to the  [5/2]5/2 level.

The  F=2 sublevel of the  2D3/2  state is not rapidly populated or depleted by 
the  laser  cooling  excitation.  Individual  quantum  jumps  to  this  state  due  to 
excitation  of  the  reference  transition  can  therefore  be  detected  through  the 
interruption of the resonance fluorescence scattering. 

In  the  experiments  described  below,  the  cooling  and  reference  transitions 
are  excited  alternately  in  measurement  cycles  of  90 ms  duration.  During  the 
excitation  of  the  reference  transition,  the  magnetic  field  is  decreased  to  the 
microtesla range in order to reduce the quadratic Zeeman frequency shift. When 
observing  the  absorption  spectrum  of  the  reference  transition,  the  excitation 
probability  to  the  2D3/2(F=2)  state  is  registered  as  a  function  of  the probe laser 
detuning. In order to operate the system as a frequency standard, both wings of 
the central resonance of the absorption spectrum are probed alternately, and the 
probe light frequency is stabilised to the line center according to the difference 
of the measured excitation probabilities. 

3  Experimental setup 

The  employed  ion  traps  are  cylindrically  symmetric  with  a  ring  electrode 
diameter of 1.4 mm. Except for the measurement of the quadrupole shift of the 
2D3/2    level, the applied trap drive voltage contained no constant component. In 
this case, the axial and radial secular motion frequencies of a trapped Yb+ ion are 
in  the  range  of  0.7 MHz  and  1.4 MHz,  respectively.  Typical  single-ion  storage 
times  are  in  the  range  of  several months.  Static  electric  stray  fields  in  the 
confinement volume are compensated in three dimensions so that the amplitude 
of stray-field induced micromotion is smaller than the secular motion amplitude 
at the Doppler cooling limit.  

Cooling radiation at 370 nm is generated by frequency doubling the output 
of an extended-cavity diode laser. Hyperfine repumping radiation is produced by 
modulating  the  injection  current  of  this  diode  laser  at  a  frequency  near 
14.7 GHz.  Extended-cavity  diode  lasers  are  also  used  to  generate  935 nm  and 
639 nm repumping radiation, and light at 871 nm which is frequency doubled in 
order  to  produce  the  436 nm  probe  radiation.  The  cooling  and  repumping 
radiation is blocked by mechanical shutters during the excitation of the reference 
transition. 

In  order  to  stabilise  the  frequency  of  the  436 nm  probe  light,  a  Pound-
Drever-Hall  scheme  is  used  to  lock  the  871 nm  diode  laser  with  a  servo 
bandwidth of 0.5 MHz to a fiber-coupled high-finesse ULE cavity. The cavity is 
suspended in vacuum by springs of 1 m length for vibration isolation. The cavity 
temperature is actively stabilised so that the drift of the 436 nm probe frequency 
is  typically  mainly  determined  by  the  0.07  Hz/s  long-term  aging  drift  of  the 
cavity material [7].

modulators, providing independent frequency shifts between the probe laser and the two ion traps. 

 

The  scheme  of  the  frequency  comparison  experiment  is  shown  in  Fig.  2. 
Both traps use the same cooling laser setup and synchronous timing schemes for 
cooling,  state  preparation,  and  state  detection.  Using  two  independent  digital 
servo  systems,  the  error  signals  resulting  from  the  probing  of  the  atomic 
resonances  are  averaged  over  typically  20  measurement  cycles  before  the 
detunings between the probe laser frequency and the probe light beams incident 
on the traps are corrected. In order to minimise servo errors due to the drift of 
the  probe  laser  frequency,  a  second-order  integrating  servo  algorithm  is  used. 
The  servo  time  constants  are  in  the  range  of  30 s.  The  differences  of  the 
detunings  imparted  on  the  probe  beams are averaged over time intervals of 1 s 
and recorded. 

4  Spectroscopy of the reference transition 

Absorption  spectra  of  the  2S1/2(F=0)  -  2D3/2(F=2)  transition  of  a  single  trapped 
171Yb+ ion are shown in Fig. 3. They were obtained using the setup described in 
Ref.  7.  In  Fig.  3,  the  frequency  resolution  increases  from  Fig.  3(a)  to  (d).  For 
Fig. 3(a)  and  (b),  the  linewidth  of  the  probe  radiation  was  increased  by  white-
noise  frequency  modulation  in  order  to  reduce  the  number  of  data  points 
required  for  the  scan.  Due  to  the  incoherent  optical  excitation,  the  absorption 
probability  here  is  limited  to  0.5  at  full  saturation.  Figure  3(a)  shows  that  the 
strength of the radial secular motion sidebands is significantly smaller than that 
of the central recoilless component. This permits the conclusion that the Lamb-
Dicke condition is well satisfied for the excitation of the reference transition. In 
Fig.  3(b),  the  Zeeman  structure  of  the  recoilless  component  is  shown  for  an 
applied  static  magnetic  field  of  approximately  1.1 m T.  Magnetic  fields  in  the 
range  of  1 m T  were  also  applied  in  the  frequency  comparison  experiments 

 

described below. Figures 3(c) and (d) show the central D mF=0-component of (b) 
for  the  case  of  coherent  p -pulse  excitation  and  approximately  Fourier-limited 
resolution. In Fig. 3(d), the maximum absorption probability is reduced relative 
to Fig. 3(c) because the short-time fluctuations of the probe laser frequency are 
not negligible relative to the Fourier linewidth limit of 27 Hz.

5  Absolute transition frequency and systematic frequency shifts  

Using  a  femtosecond  frequency  comb  generator,  the  frequency  of  the  436 nm 
2S1/2(F=0)  -  2D3/2(F=2, mF=0)  transition  of  171Yb+  was  measured  relative  to  a 
caesium  fountain  microwave  frequency  standard  [3].  The  optical-excitation 
conditions were identical to those of  Fig. 3(d).  

 measurement uncertainty of –

The  measured  absolute  frequency  is  n Yb+=  688  358  979  309  312 –

  6  Hz. 
This  frequency  value  includes  the  shift  of  the  transition  frequency  due  to 
isotropic blackbody radiation at an ambient temperature of 300 K. On the basis 
of  computed  atomic  oscillator  strengths,  the  shift  is  calculated  as  -0.4  Hz  [8]. 
The total 1 s
 6 Hz consists of approximately equal 
statistical  and  systematic  contributions.  The  dominant  source  of  the  systematic 
measurement  uncertainty  is  given  by  the  electric-quadrupole  interaction  of  the 
upper  level  of  the  reference  transition  with  the  gradient  of  stationary  electric 
stray  fields.  A  maximum  stray-field  induced  quadrupole  shift  of  the  order  of  1 
Hz  is  expected  for  atomic  D3/2  and  D5/2  states  [9].  A  non-negligible  systematic 
uncertainty contribution also arises from servo errors due to drifts of the probe 
laser frequency. The uncertainty contributions of other frequency shifting effects 
are  negligible  under  the  present  experimental  conditions.  The  magnetic  field 
applied  during  the  excitation  of  the  reference  transition  leads  to  a  quadratic 
Zeeeman  shift  of  only  0.05  Hz.  Since the trapped ion is cooled to the Doppler 
limit,  the  second-order  Doppler  and  Stark  effect  shifts  caused  by  the  trap  field 
are expected to be in the millihertz range [6]. 

6  Comparison between two traps 

Figure 4 shows the temporal variation of the frequency difference between two 
independent  171Yb+ trap and servo systems, using the experimental setup shown 
in Fig. 2. The Allan deviation of this data set is shown in Fig. 5. The conditions 
of this measurement were similar to those of Fig. 3(d).  

Using  temporally  overlapping  probe  pulses,  the  atomic  resonance  signals 
were resolved with nearly Fourier-limited linewidths of approximately 30 Hz in 
both  traps.  The  mean  frequency  difference  of  the  data  shown  in  Fig.  4  is 
<D > »
 0.2 Hz,  corresponding  to  a  relative  optical  frequency  offset  of  3(cid:215) 10-16. 
Since  <D > is  smaller  than  the  Allan  deviation  for  long  averaging  times 
(s y(t ) » 1(cid:215) 10-15 for t  ‡
 800 s), the observed offset is not statistically significant. A 
change of the drive voltage amplitude of one of the traps by 15% did not cause 
any significant frequency offset at the 1 Hz level.   

As shown in Fig. 5, the variation of the Allan deviation with the averaging 
time  t  is  in  qualitative  agreement  with  a  numerical  calculation which simulates 
the effect of quantum projection noise for the realized experimental conditions. 
The  observed  Allan  deviation  however  exceeds  the  quantum  projection  noise 

 

limit  by  approximately  a  factor  of  two.  A  possible  reason  for  this  excess 
instability are temporal fluctuations of the probe laser emission spectrum which 
can lead to fluctuating servo errors. The frequency shifts caused by this effect are 
not  necessarily  equal  for  both  servo  systems  because  the  probe  pulse  areas  by 
which the two ions were excited were not exactly matched.

frequency  difference  calculated  from  this  data  set  is  0.2  Hz.  The  intervals  without  data  points 
correspond to times when no frequency correction signal was produced by one of the trapped ions.

7  Quadrupole shift measurement  

One  expects  that the interaction of the quadrupole moment of the  2D3/2  state of 
171Yb+ with a static electric field gradient leads to a shift of the frequency of the 
436 nm  reference  transition.  In  order  to  experimentally  determine  the  171Yb+ 
quadrupole moment, a static field gradient was generated in one of the traps by 
superimposing a constant (dc) voltage on the radiofrequency trap drive voltage. 
The orientation of this field gradient is determined by the symmetry axis of the 
trap.Theother trap was operated with a pure rf voltage and served as a reference. 
The  result  of  a  corresponding  frequency  comparison  measurement  is  shown  in 
Fig. 6.

Field gradient (V/mm2)

function of the dc field gradient generated in one of the traps. The application of a positive voltage 
to  the  endcap  electrodes  increases  the  optical  frequency.  The  error  bars  show  the  statistical 
measurement uncertainty. 

 

A three-axis magnetic field sensor was used to determine the orientation of 
the  static  magnetic  field  relative  to  the  applied  field  gradient.  Using  the 
formalism  described  in  Ref.  9,  we  infer  a  quadrupole  moment  of  Q
  = 
(3.9 –
2 for the 2D3/2 level of Yb+ with e being the electron charge and a0 
the Bohr radius. The uncertainty of the inferred Q
 value is mainly determined by 
the uncertainty of the measurement of the angle between the magnetic field and 
the trap axis.
