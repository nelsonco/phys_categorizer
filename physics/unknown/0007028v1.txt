Abstract
The proposed Next Linear Collider (NLC) contains linac
systems operating at L,S,C, and X band. This paper
describes a wideband modular low-level RF (LLRF) sys-
tem applicable for all NLC pulsed RF systems. High speed
digital IF techniques are used for both arbitrary klystron
drive modulation and accurate RF vector detection. Mea-
surement of relative beam to RF phase, beam loading com-
pensation, and structure dipole modes for automated
alignment are all handled by the system. Modern signal
processing techniques are also described.

1.  INTRODUCTION

The NLC is essentially a pair of opposing X-band linacs
designed to collide 500 GeV electrons and positrons. The
main linac RF system is a major driving cost for the
project consisting of 1600 X-band klystron tubes and
related hardware. Pulse stacking RF techniques are used to
efﬁciently develop the 600MW 300ns RF pulses required
at each girder. A group of 8 klystrons (an 8 pack) deliver
RF power to 8 girders, each girder supports 3 accelerator
structures. Pulse stacking and beam loading compensation
requires fast modulation of the klystron drive signal. A
programmable digital IF solution will be presented.

The absolute phase of the accelerating RF with respect
to the beam is a critical parameter which must be mea-
sured and controlled to the 1 degree X-band level. Even
with a state-of-the-art stabilized ﬁber optic RF refer-
ence/distribution system, there will still be phase drifts
present in the system which will require measuring the rel-
ative phase between the beam and accelerating RF at regu-
lar intervals. The techniques for making this and other
X-band measurements are described in this paper can be
applied to any linac RF system.

Transverse alignment must be achieved to extremely
tight tolerances to prevent excitation of transverse modes.
Each accelerator is a damped detuned structure which is
designed to load down the undesirable high-order modes
(HOMs) and allow their external detection to facilitate
alignment of each girder [1]. The shape of each individual
accelerating cell in a structure is altered slightly along the
length of the structure making the HOM frequencies a
function of the longitudinal position on the structure. The
frequency of the lowest order transverse mode ranges from
14 to 16 GHz corresponding to upstream and downstream
respectively [2]. A receiver will be outlined which mea-
sures the beam induced HOMs allowing automated align-
ment of each girder via remote mechanical movers.

2.  KLYSTRON DRIVE GENERATION

For the main linac system the output of 8 klystrons will be
combined to deliver X-band RF to 8 accelerator girders
through a high power distribution and delay system
(DLDS) (ﬁgure 1). Each ~3us klystron pulse will be time
multiplexed to steer RF power successively to 8 accelera-
tor girders by quickly modulating the relative phases of the
klystron drive during a pulse. Wideband klystrons
(>100MHz) will allow rapid phase switching to improve
overall efﬁciency. Fixed delays in the DLDS deliver RF
power a ﬁll time in advance of the beam.

To compensate for beam loading, klystrons will be pre-
cisely phase ramped during the ﬁrst ~100ns of each
sub-pulse to direct some RF power to a port which is out
of time with the beam. This allows the klystrons to operate
in saturation while minimizing the energy spread across
the 95 bunch train. To compensate for unknown transmis-
sion phase shifts the system must produce any drive phase
and allow a smooth transition to any other phase. Speciﬁ-
cations for the main linac LLRF drive system are listed
below in table 1.

An in-phase/quadrature (IQ) drive generation system
was produced for the next linear collider test accelerator
(NLCTA) [3]. Two high speed (250 MS/S) DACs were
used to drive an X-band baseband IQ modulator (ﬁgure 2).
The IQ technique works but is sensitive to mixer offsets,
quadrature errors, baseband noise and requires two DACs.

To reduce system cost and improve accuracy a digital IF
approach is being pursued (ﬁgure 3). A modulated IF tone
burst is generated by a single programmable DAC channel
and up-mixed with a locked local oscillator (LO) to drive
the klystron preampliﬁer. The IF frequency must be high
enough to meet the system bandwidth requirements and
allow ﬁlters to be realized which reject the image and the
LO leakage. Frequency multipliers can be used to raise the
IF frequency without increasing the DAC clock rate at the
expense of phase resolution. A single sideband modulator
can be used to reduce the image amplitude.

It is important to note that the phase of the output RF is
a function of the phase of the (multiplied) DAC produced
tone burst and the phase of the LO when the DAC is trig-
gered. By choosing the IF frequency to be an integer mul-
tiple of the bunch separation frequency (357 MHz for
NLC), the phase of the accelerating RF will repeat for
each bunch time slot (equations 1-4). This eliminates the
need to load a differently phased DAC waveform or to
resynchronize the LO before each machine pulse.

To estimate the DAC resolution required to produce
1(cid:176)
drive phase shifts refer to ﬁgure 4. If we use the full
DAC range to synthesize the IF waveform then the mini-
mum phase shift we can resolve corresponds to a one bit
change at a zero crossing. A 7 bit DAC at the IF frequency
is required. If multiplication is used to raise the IF fre-
quency more bits are needed. A x8 multiplier requires 3
additional bits. Producing the 89.15 MHz sub-IF with a 12
bit device will allow operating the DAC below full scale.

Applying the digital IF signal generation technique to
other NLC linac systems operating at different frequencies
simply requires a different RF modulator and LO refer-
ence. The system bandwidth required to support X-band
linac pulse switching will easily support SLED cavity PSK
or compressor beam loading compensation requirements.
Maintaining the systems will also become less specialized
since the DAC/IF hardware and some software will be
identical for all klystrons operating at L,C,S, or X-band.

3.  DIGITAL RF VECTOR DETECTION

To conﬁgure the NLC main linac RF systems, measure-
ment techniques must be available to allow proper align-
ment of the accelerating RF to the beam. Again, a digital
IF technique is being planned. The unknown RF signal is
mixed down to an IF frequency, ampliﬁed, dither added
(optional), and sampled with a high speed ADC (ﬁgure 5).
The choice of the receiver IF frequency is less constrained
than for klystron drive generation. The 89.25 MHz IF sys-
tem shown will have 4 possible phase offsets for measure-
ments triggered on 4 consecutive 357 MHz clocks. If the
sample phase offset for each measured IF pulse were
known it could be corrected for during post processing.
Alternatively, a 357 MHz IF could be used. Undersam-
pling techniques would be used to keep sample rates and
memory requirements reasonable while maintaining sufﬁ-
cient channel bandwidth.

Deriving wideband amplitude and phase vectors from
a sampled IF waveform can be achieved by applying a Hil-
bert transform. The Hilbert technique involves taking the
Fourier transform of the sampled IF data, nulling all nega-
tive frequency bins, scaling positive bins by 2, and ﬁnally
taking the inverse Fourier transform. This produces a com-
plex time domain vector allowing calculation of amplitude
and phase vectors (ﬁgure 6). While in the frequency
domain, ﬁltering may be applied by nulling any undesired
spectral bins, potentially enhancing algorithm efﬁciency.

digital IF techniques. The receiver bandwidth was 20 MHz.

To allow automated conﬁguration of the RF systems
several measurements must be available (ﬁgure 7). The RF
output of each klystron output coupler (P1,P2) must be
measured to monitor klystron performance. The loaded
accelerating RF is measured to allow compensating for
beam loading and properly phasing the RF to the beam.
Structure transverse alignment is determined by measuring
the beam induced dipole modes (X,Y). A beam pickup can
provide a phase reference if the receiver LO is chosen not
to be locked to the machine reference.

the phase of the accelerating RF can be compared to the

(ﬁgure 8) indicates that the relative angle must be mea-

accuracy. Simulations show 200 averages
of a dithered 89.25 MHz IF using a 7 bit ADC to sample
the 285ns burst would be required. Both techniques are
truly differential allowing absolute resolution of RF/beam

Measurement of the 14-16 GHz structure dipole modes
requires a variable LO source to mix the desired signal
down to the IF frequency. A ﬁlter and a RF limiter before
the mixer are required to limit peak power when the struc-
ture is misaligned. A triple bandpass ﬁlter passes dipole
modes harmonically related to bunch spacing and corre-
sponding to the center and both ends of the structure.
Additional IF gain (30dB) will be applied when the signals
become small
to produce the 65 dB dynamic range
required to measure 1 micron offsets with a single shot
pilot bunch (no averaging). Recently a receiver has been
tested on a structure and beam reference pickup installed
in the SLAC linac (ﬁgure 9).

The digital IF technique proposed to produce arbitrary
drive waveforms and accurately detect accelerator RF sig-
nals has produced encouraging initial tests results. The
development of a high speed DAC/ADC module is
planned. A full 8 pack test installation is planned.

The most difﬁcult measurement task is determining the
RF/beam phase during single bunch operation. The struc-
ture output RF port allows direct measurement of the
accelerating RF, loaded RF, or the beam induced RF (no
input RF applied). Dynamic range is an issue since a sin-
gle pilot bunch of 1e9 particles induces RF 40dB below
the accelerating RF. By applying dither to the IF (ﬁgure 5)
and averaging 10 pulses, the pilot bunch phase can be
measured to
accuracy (no klystron RF). Alternatively
