Physics Faculty and Educational Researchers: Divergent 
Expectations as Barriers to the Diffusion of Innovations 
 

Abstract 

Physics Education Research (PER) practitioners have engaged in substantial curriculum 

development and dissemination work in recent years.  Yet, it appears that this work has had 

minimal influence on the fundamental teaching practices of typical physics faculty.  To better 

understand this situation interviews were conducted with 5 likely users of physics education 

research.  All reported making changes in their instructional practices and all were influenced, to 

some extent, by educational research.  Yet, none made full use of educational research and most 

had complaints about their interactions with educational researchers.  In this paper we examine 

how these instructors used educational research in making instructional decisions and identify 

divergent expectations about how researchers and faculty can work together to improve student 

learning.  Although different instructors emphasized different aspects of this discrepancy 

between expectations, we believe that they are all related to a single underlying issue: the typical 

dissemination model is to disseminate curricular innovations and have faculty adopt them with 

minimal changes while faculty expect researchers to work with them to incorporate research-

based knowledge and materials into their unique instructional situations.  Implications and 

recommendations are discussed.

I. Introduction 

In recent decades, Physics Education Research (PER) has developed knowledge about issues 

related to the teaching and learning of physics as well as successful instructional strategies and 

materials based on this knowledge.  It is unclear, however, what effect these substantial efforts 

have had on the actual teaching of introductory college-level physics.  Evidence from empirical 
studies1,2,3 as well as the opinions of prominent National committees (for example, see Refs 7 
and 8) and PER practitioners9-11 all suggest that most physics instructors continue to use 
traditional teaching practices12 and that dissemination of reforms is an important unsolved 

problem. For example, as the rationale for its 2003 report, the Committee on Undergraduate 
Science Education8 points to the strong STEM research base on effective teaching approaches 

and then questions “why introductory science courses in many colleges and universities still rely 

primarily on lectures and recipe-based laboratory sessions where students memorize facts and 

concepts, but have little opportunity for reflection, discussion, or testing of ideas?” (p. 1) 

To better understand this dissemination problem, we conducted interviews with a purposeful 

sample of five physics faculty who we believe represent highly likely users of educational 

research.  All reported making changes in their instructional practices and all were influenced, to 

some extent, by educational research.  Yet, none made full use of educational research and most 

had complaints about their interactions with educational researchers.  In this paper we examine 

how these instructors used educational research in making instructional decisions and identify 

differences in expectations that appear to be barriers to more full use of educational research.  

We expect that these barriers are not unique to the instructors in this study. 

Elsewhere,14,15 we describe other results from this study.  Most notably that all of the faculty 

interviewed expressed beliefs about teaching and learning that were more compatible with 

research-based instructional suggestions than were their self-described instructional practices.  

When asked about this discrepancy, the instructors cited strong situational constraints that made 

it difficult to teach in a non-traditional manner.  Commonalities such as large class sizes, broad 

content coverage expectations, classroom infrastructure, scheduling constraints, poor student 

preparation/motivation, and the institutional reward system all appear to favor traditional 

instruction.  The importance of these situational factors and the associated implications for the 
PER community cannot be ignored and are discussed elsewhere.11,14  It also became apparent in 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

the interviews, however, that educational researchers and other physics faculty had different 

expectations about how the two groups should work together to improve student learning.  This 

discrepancy was expressed directly (and often emotionally) by three of the five instructors we 

interviewed and indirectly by the other two.  Although different instructors emphasized different 

aspects of this discrepancy, we believe that they are all related to a single underlying issue: the 

typical dissemination model is to disseminate curricular innovations and have faculty adopt them 

with minimal changes while faculty expect researchers to work with them to incorporate 

research-based knowledge and materials into their unique instructional situations.  

Divergent expectations are not the only barriers to change.  However, unlike many other barriers 

(situational factors, for example) the PER community has significant control over their 

interactions with non-PER faculty.  Thus, we believe that it is quite useful to explore these 

divergent expectations and implications they might have for potential changes to curriculum 

development and dissemination. 

Divergent Expectations 

Expectations, of course, are important in all human interactions and divergent expectations often 

result in conflict.  For example, in her work on male-female communication, Debora Tannen 

found that males and females often have different expectations for conversations about 
troubles.16,17  Men tend to expect conversations about troubles to arrive at a solution.  Women, on 

the other hand, tend to expect conversations about troubles to develop intimacy.  Thus, when a 

woman shares her troubles with a man the woman often feels that the man isn’t listening because 

he focuses on solving the problem and doesn’t share his own problems.  The man becomes 

frustrated because the woman continues to talk about her problems without an apparent interest 

in a solving them.  

Closer to education, divergent student-teacher expectations may result in conflict when teachers 

attempt to use innovative instructional methods.  For example, students and instructors in science 

classes often abide by a “hidden contract” whereby students are responsible for sitting quietly 

and asking clarifying questions while teachers are responsible for presenting clear lectures and 
solving example exercises that are not too different from test questions.18  A student who expects 

to sit passively in such a class will likely be frustrated and resist an instructor who expects class 
to be interactive.19  Likewise, the instructor is likely to be frustrated by this resistance.20

II. Participants and Data Collection 

The purpose of this study was to understand barriers to instructional change.  Because current 

models of the change process are not able to account for the slow rate of instructional change in 
college level physics, a primary goal of this project was to generate new categories of barriers.21  

Thus, we used exploratory interviews with a small sample of instructors who have qualities that, 
according to diffusion-based change models,22-24 are likely to result in successful instructional 

change. 

A. Participants 

Interviews were conducted with five tenured physics faculty from four different institutions (one 

small liberal arts college, two regional universities, and one major research university).  These 

faculty had no formal connections with the Physics Education Research (PER) community and 

were purposefully chosen.  We targeted faculty we believed should be ideal consumers of 

research-based reform.  They were all senior faculty with a reputation for being particularly 

thoughtful and reflective teachers in introductory level physics at their institutions.  They all 

valued teaching, had a strong desire to see their students succeed, and, as discussed later, were all 

inclined to consider making changes in their instructional practices.  If, as is commonly stated, 

the goal of the physics education reform movement is to create a critical mass of instructors 

using reformed pedagogical approaches, this type of instructor can be expected to form the core 

of that critical mass.  Thus, any difficulties in interacting with these instructors are very 

important to understand and remedy.   

B. Interview 

Each semi-structured exploratory interview lasted over one hour and contained open-ended 

questions about instructional goals, current and past instructional practices, attempts to change 

practices, and familiarity with educational research.  For example, questions about instructional 

change included: (a) How has your practice changed over the course of your career? (b) What 

has caused you to try new things? (c) What have you tried that you have abandoned?  Why? (d) 

What things make it difficult for you to change? (e) What things have supported your efforts to 

change?  Following each of these general questions, the interviewer (either CH or MD) asked 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 4 of 37 

probing questions to elicit specific details about the interviewee’s experiences with instructional 

change.  Each interview was transcribed for analysis. 

III. Analysis 

In analyzing the interview data we were guided by Clement’s levels of knowledge.21  In this 

hierarchy, the lowest level, Level 1, is primary-level data.  In our study these were individual 

statements made by the instructors during an interview.  Level 2 is observed patterns and 

empirical laws.  In our study these were similarities in ideas expressed in the statements made by 

different instructors.  For example, one pattern we noticed was that the instructors often used 

basic ideas from educational research, but yet changed these ideas significantly during 

implementation.  Level 3 is the researchers’ explanatory models.  In our study this is the idea of 

divergent expectations between change agents and instructors as an important barrier to the 

diffusion of PER innovations.  The goal of an explanatory model is to describe a hidden 

mechanism that explains the observed patterns.  This not only adds explanatory power, but also 

leads to growth of theory.  Finally, Level 4 is formal principles and theoretical commitments.  

These are the result of repeated testing and refinement of explanatory models in a variety of 

situations.  Thus, we cannot make any Level 4 claims from this initial generative study. 

As is common with generative studies, our analysis began with an open coding process of 
constructing categories of statements from the interview transcripts.25  Patterns were then sought 

between and among different categories.  Throughout this exploratory process both researchers 

were engaged in the creation, critiquing, and refinement of the emerging categories.  Looking for 

patterns between categories helped to sharpen the category boundaries.  The results section will 

describe three categories of self-described instructor behavior related to instructional change and 

four categories related to interactions between the instructors and educational researchers. 

IV. Theoretical Basis 

Although the purpose of this study was to generate new ideas, it was conducted and interpreted 

within the framework of our existing ideas.  In this section we propose an adoption-invention 

continuum which describes important characteristics of possible interactions between educational 

researchers and other faculty.  We also make and support the claim that many change agents 

operate on the adoption side of this continuum.

A. Adoption-Invention Continuum 

There are two important participants in the instructional change process.  One is the instructors 

who are interested in or being asked to change their instruction.  The other, change agents, are 

curriculum developers or professional development providers who provide information, 

materials, encouragement, etc. to help the instructors.   

There is a body of literature that explores how these two types of participants interact in the 
change process.22-24  Models of the change process typically include at least three activities: (1) 

instructor becomes aware of a problem with current practice, (2) instructor develops knowledge 

about a new practice that can minimize or solve the problem, and (3) instructor implements the 

new practice.  There are three basic levels of knowledge that can be developed during the second 
phase:23 “awareness” knowledge (knowledge that the instructional strategy exists), “how-to” 

knowledge (basic knowledge about how to use the strategy properly), and “principles” 

knowledge (knowledge about why the strategy works – essential for solving unexpected 

problems that occur during use).  Although much of the literature on educational change deals 

with instructional changes that are developed and disseminated by external change agents, it is 

important to note that innovations do not necessarily come from external sources, but may be 
developed entirely by an instructor.26  We believe this observation should be accounted for in 

theories of change.  

We have identified four basic categories of change that vary in terms of the roles of the external 

change agent and the instructor in the change process (Figure 1).  These are not discrete 

categories, but rather occur on a continuum.  We have found it useful, however, to use these 

category labels to represent general locations along the continuum.  Notably, the responsibilities 

of the change agent and instructor change significantly as one moves across the continuum 

(Figure 2).  At the adoption pole the change agent develops all of the materials and procedures 

and gives them to the instructor to implement as is.  In its extreme, this pole represents a change 

agent view that the instructor is irrelevant.  At the invention pole the instructor develops 

everything with minimal external influence.  In its extreme, this pole represents an instructor 

view that educational research is irrelevant.  Under adaptation and reinvention, the general idea 

of a new instructional strategy comes from an external source, but the instructor is responsible 

for developing important aspects of the strategy.  Although it is possible for an instructor to 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 6 of 37 

develop these aspects of the strategy with the assistance of a change agent, typically the 

instructor develops these aspects of the strategy on their own.  These instructor-developed 

principles and details are not always consistent with “best practices” as identified in the 
educational research literature.26-31 

B. Change Agents Expect Adoption/Adaptation 

In the remainder of this paper we will examine the expectations that our sample of five physics 

faculty have about their interactions with change agents.  However, it is important to first 

examine the expectations that change agents have.  Although, there are certainly a wide variety 

of change agents with a wide variety of expectations, it appears that most change agents operate 
near the adoption/adaptation end of the continuum.32  This is evident in much of the discourse 

related to educational change that focuses substantial efforts on developing and testing specific 

instructional innovations.  Once proved successful by their developer, these innovations are then 

disseminated to instructors who are expected to use them with fidelity.  The instructor is not an 

important part of the development of these strategies and, in fact, is often considered to be a 
barrier to educational change.8,33-36  As an example, consider the model of curriculum 

development and dissemination advocated by the NSF-CCLI program (Figure 3).  This model 

shows the change agent responsibilities as conducting research, developing materials and then 
helping faculty develop expertise in using these materials.37 

There is nothing inherently wrong with this perspective.  A change agent might imagine that the 

adoption model would be most effective since it places much of the burden on the change agent 

to develop innovative strategies and materials.  This takes considerable time and expertise that 

typical faculty may not possess.  It would be reasonable to assume that faculty expect this sort of 

interaction with educational researchers.  In addition, the adoption model is important for 

researchers who are attempting to determine the efficacy of a new instructional method.  It is 

difficult to draw conclusions unless all of the participating faculty are doing more or less the 

same things.   

In spite of these reasons from the change agent perspective that support change agent-instructor 

interactions on the adoption/adaptation end of the continuum, it is important to understand how 

instructors perceive their actual and desired interactions with change agents.

V. RESULTS 

In this section we present our findings regarding the experiences of the faculty with instructional 

change followed by a discussion of the perceptions of the faculty regarding the educational 

research community and products.   

A. Behavior Related to Instructional Change 

As discussed earlier, the existing literature on instructional change suggests useful categories for 

describing instructor behavior related to instructional change.  We categorized each instructor’s 

self-described instructional changes in terms of three basic activities, (1) identifying a problem 

with existing instruction, (2) becoming aware of or developing a potential solution, and (3) 

implementing the solution.  Thus, we can examine the extent to which each activity is 

accomplished and the interactions between instructor and change agent that facilitate or hinder 

each activity.   

Identifying problems with practice 

All of the instructors felt that they faced instructional problems that could, at least potentially, be 

improved via changes in their instructional practices (Table 1).  Although these instructional 

problems appear to be largely consistent with problems identified by educational research, it was 

seldom clear from the interviews how these instructors first became aware of these problems -- 

whether they identified the problems on their own or with the help of educational research.  In 

most cases, though, the instructors report that their belief in the importance of and their 

understanding of the instructional problems has been enhanced through their interactions with 

educational researchers.  For example, Mary describes “always” having the philosophy that 

students don’t get much from a traditional lecture and that class should be more interactive 
(Mary 70)38.  Yet, she describes not realizing the gravity of the situation until giving the Force 
Concept Inventory39 (FCI): “Just the fact that somebody can go through the entire class and still 

think that you needed a force to cause motion was an eye opener.” (Mary 233-234). 

Becoming Aware of Research-Based Instructional Methods 

Not only were these instructors aware of problems with their instruction, but they were also 

aware of research-based instructional innovations that might be useful in solving the problems.  

Four of the five instructors were reasonably familiar with Physics Education Research (PER).  

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 8 of 37 

They were aware of the names and basic practices involved with innovative curricula as well as a 

number of more general strategies (Table 2).  The fifth instructor (Gary), while not explicitly 

familiar with PER had been exposed to general research-based teaching techniques through a 

residential grant-sponsored program.  Thus, these instructors appear to have a reasonable degree 

of knowledge about possible solutions to the instructional problems that they face.   

Making Instructional Changes  

During the interview we asked the instructors to describe instructional changes that they had 

made and how their knowledge of educational research had influenced these changes, if at all.  

We were then able to classify each of these self-reported changes on the adoption-invention 

continuum (Table 3).  The classifications were based on the definitions of each category 

described earlier (Figures 1 and 2).  Below is an example for each category to clarify the 

categorization. 

Adoption: Use of CSEM as an assessment instrument 

After talking about some of the instructional changes he had made, Harry was asked how he 

knows whether the changes are working or not.  After discussing how he uses informal cues 

during class time to assess student understanding he commented that he made use of pre-post 
testing using the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism40 (CSEM):  “CSEM scores are 

another good thing.  If your CSEM scores are good then, you must be, well, of course you could 

just be teaching to the test, but assuming that you aren’t teaching to the test, then presumably 

you are doing something right.” (Harry, 125-127)  This use of the CSEM comes directly from 

and is consistent with the use recommended by educational researchers. 

Adaptation: Use of Physlets 

Barry discussed learning about Physlets after attending a colloquium by one of the developers 
and coming across them on internet searches and on Merlot.41  He discussed integrating Physlets 

into his courses as a source of animations during class (Barry 606-607).  Because the Physlet 

developers present Physlets as a flexible technological resource, pure adoption is not possible.  

The developers say that Physlets can be used as classroom demonstrations, but leave the 
instructor to adapt the resource to their own pedagogical strategies.42  The use of Physlets as a 

demonstration appears to be based on the educational principle that an animation can help

students visualize physics concepts better than static illustrations.  Barry indicated that he based 

his use of Physlets on this principle and did not indicate modifying the available Physlets in any 

way. 

Reconstruction: Use of Small Group Work Involving White Boards to Increase Interactivity 

Many of the instructional recommendations based on physics education research focus on ways 
to make the classroom more interactive and students more mentally active.43  One suggestion for 
how to do this involves having students work in groups on small white boards.44  Mary was 

aware of the importance of interactivity in the classroom and became aware of the use of white 

boards through PER.  In using white boards, however, she appears to have developed most of the 

principles and practices herself based on her interest in promoting interactivity, but also her 

concern with promoting problem solving skills and with motivating students.  She described 

assigning a problem during class for students to solve in their assigned groups on white boards.  

After students worked for a while “I take a white board and choose three or four representative 

ones, bring them to the front of the room and we talk about them as a whole group.  What were 

they trying to do?  Why isn’t this a valid approach?  What is wrong with the picture that made 

the whole problem not follow correctly from it?  This group, where did they get caught?  Why is 

this right?  And that seems to help a lot with their motivation because they like seeing their 

answers up there.” (Mary, 633-638) 

Invention: Soliciting Questions to Encourage Students to Read the Text 

Harry was aware that students do not often read the text before coming to class and also that it is 

important for the instructor to know what difficulties students are having.  Although he was 
aware that Mazur recommended giving pre class reading quizzes to solve this problem,19 Harry 

developed his own technique where he asked students to submit a question to him about the 

reading via email.  (Harry 31-33)  This is consistent with best practices since it encourages 

students to think about their own understanding of the topic and provides the instructor with an 

understanding of how the students are thinking about the topic and specific difficulties that they 

are encountering.

Instructors Engage in Informed Invention and Invention 

Notice from Table 3 that most (70%) of the 20 identifiable changes reported by the instructors 

fell on the reinvention/invention side of the continuum.  Half of the changes fell in the 

reinvention category.  This means that the instructors generally agreed with education research 

on what the problems were and the general idea of the solutions, but did not take the complete 

research-based solutions and implement them.  They developed or substantially changed the 

principles and details of the solution.  The only adaptations were in the use of Physlets and small 

group work.  Both Terry and Barry reported using Physlets as demonstrations in class to help 

students visualize physics phenomena.  Barry also reported having small groups work on 

homework-like problems based on a similar practice by one of his colleagues.  The only 
adoptions were the three instructors who report using the Force Concept Inventory39 (FCI) and/or 
Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism40 (CSEM) as assessments in their courses.  

Although these are not instructional strategies per se, they are important PER products.  All 

instructors reported using these products as recommended.  For example, none described using 

subsets of the tests to evaluate their instruction. 

As would be expected, if faculty develop the details of implementation on their own, some are 

likely to do so in a way that is consistent with the current research-based understanding of 

teaching/learning and others are likely to do so in a way that is inconsistent.  The examples given 

previously of reinvention and invention were ones that we judged to be consistent with current 

research-based understanding of teaching and learning.  Below, are examples of reinvention and 

invention that we judged to be inconsistent with the current research base.  

Reinvention incompatible with PER: Fundamental Modifications to Peer Instruction 

Terry was aware of Peer Instruction and had concerns about his instruction that Peer Instruction 

was designed to improve (e.g., students don’t get much from a traditional lecture).  He described 

using Mazur’s and his own ConcepTests in instruction, but using them in a very different way 

than Mazur advocates.  Mazur argues that student-student discussion of ConcepTests is an 
essential component of Peer Instruction.19  Terry, however, reports rarely having students discuss 

with one another.  Also, suggesting incompatible use of Peer Instruction, Terry reports that it is 

quite common for all students to answer a ConcepTest correctly.  Mazur, however, suggests that 

ConcepTests are most effective when the “initial percentage of correct answers is around 50%” 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Page 11 of 37 

(ref 19, p. 12).  This suggests that the questions Terry uses are inappropriately easy (by Mazur’s 

definition) or that the procedure used to determine student understanding is not accurate (he did 

not describe how he measured student responses to ConcepTests during the interview).   

Invention incompatible with PER: Assigning Reading Exercises to Encourage Students to Read 

the Text 

Similar to Harry, Gary was aware that students do not often read the text before coming to class.  

As a solution to this problem Gary developed a set of 20 to 30 short reading exercises for each 

assigned chapter that students were expected to complete before the topic was discussed in class.  

He describes each question as being “real short, the answers should be right there, and I make 

up the exercises while I’m looking at the book, to make sure the answer is really available. . . It 

will be things like ah, maybe a question on the definition of a new concept.  What is specific 

heat?  or What’s the equation that describes specific heat and what’s the symbol that’s used for 

specific heat, what are the units for specific heat.  It’s just really making them consciously think 

about that at least once for 15 seconds.  So, yeah, they ought to be able to just breeze right 

through it.”  (Gary 51-63)  We describe this as incompatible with PER because the reading 

exercises do not appear to encourage students to deeply engage with the material or their 

understanding of it, but rather to focus on surface level details, something that educational 
research warns against.45 

B. Interactions between Educational Researchers and Instructors 

Although all of the instructors reported making some instructional changes and these changes 

were often precipitated by a general idea from research (i.e., the reinvention mode), most of the 

research-based resources and knowledge were not used.  Why would instructors engage in 

reinvention and invention when there is so much good research-based work readily available?  

During the interviews it became apparent that these instructors had problems not only with some 

of the results of education research, but also with the way in which research practitioners 

disseminated these results.  Many of these instructors expressed great frustration with this 

situation.  They appear to want different things from the research community than they perceive 

the community as currently offering.  In the following paragraphs we describe four categories 

that emerged related to the interactions between researchers and the instructors.  

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 12 of 37 

Three of the instructors (Mary, Terry, and Harry) were reasonably familiar with modern PER 

research.  They all articulated their belief that PER expected adoption/adaptation and they 

indicated a specific resistance to this mode.  Thus, many of the barriers discussed here come 

from their interviews.  Barry was aware of some of the PER results and curricula and indicated 

that he often discussed teaching and learning issues with a PER researcher and colleague who he 

described as a close personal friend.  He did not describe other interactions with the PER 

community or any knowledge of PER outside of this personal relationship.  Gary did not indicate 

an explicit awareness of any modern PER research or products; however, he appeared to be 

aware of basic practices of some PER curricula, such as Peer Instruction.  

Category I. PER is perceived as dogmatic 

The interviewed faculty tended to see educational researchers as not really interested in them or 

their students, but rather as promoting a particular curriculum.  Instructors described what they 

saw as this sales or evangelist mentality of PER practitioners as making their interactions 

somewhat confrontational.  “The interactions between the two tend to be that the teacher is 

critical, the education researcher is trying to make a point, and a lot of time the conversation 

between the two, as soon as it hits a snag . . ., they [the educational researcher] hide behind 

what feels like a smoke screen.” (Mary 742-746)  Instructors also criticized researchers as 

promoting their instructional package or technique with the expectation that it will work well in 

any environment, even ones quite different from the one in which it was developed.  “All of those 

people seem to think that their way is the only way. . .   That the only way that a student’s going 

to learn is if I stop doing this and start doing that.  And I argue that in fact that’s unfair to both 

teachers and students.  I think that in fact that we need to be telling teachers and students is that 

students learn in many different ways, that teachers teach well in many different ways and that 

they ought to be trying to find in the things that are presented by some good solid research or 

whatever ways in which they need to be addressing the students they have in the place where 

they have them. And I think the one size fits all is not very good for the whole physics 

community.” (Terry 733-739)  Finally, several instructors thought that educational researchers 

were not being honest with them and that many PER curricula had flaws that were not usually 

mentioned or don’t work as promised.

Harry: I thought it [Peer Instruction] was taking up a large amount of time.  I mean I’d be 

spending most of a class on a couple of these questions. 

Interviewer: And, do you know why that is, because that seems different from what Eric Mazur 

talks about?  He talks about taking 2-3 minutes. 

Harry: No. Others have tried to apply that here and they’ll tell you the same thing.  It winds up 

taking an inordinate amount of time.  Now we might not be applying it right.  But, you know, I 

just xeroxed his problems and put them on the overhead. (Harry 532-538) 

Some instructors also noted that, even though researchers often present PER as if there is only 

one way to teach, there are often times when there does not appear to be agreement among 

researchers as to what constitutes best practices: “I haven’t gone to a completely, just group 

work, which seems, some of the research seems to indicated that that’s the best thing to do.  But 

then again, I’ve looked at other research and they did only one interactive session per week and 

seemed to have the same results as other groups who did totally interactive.” (Mary, 545-549)  

Category II: Perception That PER Says I’m a Bad Teacher 

The research community has put a great deal of effort into discrediting traditional transmissionist 

instructional approaches.  It is not unusual for researchers to report studies where research-based 

innovations are compared to more traditional lecture-based approaches with the innovation being 

shown to be superior.  While it is likely necessary for faculty to become dissatisfied with the 

traditional approach to teaching before they will consider alternatives, evidence from this study 
(see Table 1) and other studies1 suggest that this dissatisfaction already exists for many faculty.  

While it is clearly important to emphasize differences between research-based practices and 

traditional instruction, it appears this approach can be problematic if done without consideration 

for the emotional reactions that can be engendered.   

The faculty we interviewed described emotional reactions to the message of educational 

researchers.  These instructors saw educational researchers as insinuating that they are bad 

teachers.  “The first word out of their [a typical PER presenter] mouth is you’re not doing things 

right.” (Terry 831-832) “If you tell me that you think my teaching is bad that automatically sets 

up a barrier.  If I tell you that the only really good way to teach introductory physics is X, I’ve 

again set up some kind of barrier. . . I think there’s just too much of that going on right now.”

(Terry 954-957) This was often due to researchers who contrast pedagogical practices that they 

believe faculty commonly engage in with instructional practices that the researcher is promoting.  

“Basically what [specific educational researcher] does is . . . gives you a lot of practical help on 

ways you can go wrong.  Don’t think this will work because these students are interpreting it this 

way.  I’ve taken a lot of those things to heart, but I’m not sure I know where to go.  You know, it 

can be paralyzing some of these dicta.” (Harry 440-444)   

These faculty care about their students and have done their best with the knowledge they 

possessed and under the circumstances they found themselves.  An important part of their 

identity is their role as an expert teacher.  It is difficult for them when they perceive that the 

research community is telling them that they’ve been doing it all wrong and perhaps even 

causing harm to their students.  Not unexpectedly, their reaction can be defensive.    

Instead of making them feel they are bad teachers and that they are being told to adopt research 

innovations because the researchers know best, these instructors would like the research 

community to recognize that they have valuable experiences and expertise and work with them to 

improve teaching and learning.  “[I want the research community to say] not that you’re doing a 

bad job, but here are some new ways that this community has discovered about how students 

learn, ways in which students can learn better, topics in which students have the most serious 

trouble.” (Terry, 855-857) 

These faculty are, in fact, correct. They are expert teachers with a career of experiences who are 

capable of using their knowledge to integrate research based ideas into their own classrooms.  

They agree that they can improve their instruction but want their expertise and experiences to be 

respected.  The instructors want to work with the research community to make improvements 

and not be made to feel their ideas are being judged or discounted.   

Category III: Educational Research Results and Methods are Questioned 

In addition to not necessarily trusting the motives of educational researchers and not feeling that 

their professional knowledge was validated, faculty also identified many flaws they perceived in 

educational research methods that they used to justify discounting some results.

Example 1:  PER places too much emphasis on conceptual inventories like the FCI 

Instructors criticized the widespread use of conceptual inventories like the FCI and CSEM.  They 

tended to think that the limited content covered was a significant drawback.  “The FCI is a very 

short, very focused topical test made up by a certain group of faculty members who have 

obviously a certain bias in the process and its got 30 questions on basically Newton’s three 

laws.” (Terry 860-862)  Also, most suggested that the scores were not terribly meaningful since 

it is very easy to teach to the test.  “The real flaw, as a scientist, that I see with the FCI is you 

know what the questions are ahead of time.  So, the potential for teaching to the test is huge.  

And, and, consciously or unconsciously being aware of exactly what’s going to be asked, just has 

too big of an influence about how a class is taught.  And it’s just too easy, even if a teacher 

doesn’t want to, to overemphasize some detail.” (Mary 493-498) 

Example 2: PER uses inappropriate comparison courses 

Many instructors criticized the comparison courses used in PER studies. 

“All of these studies tend to be done with people who are very concerned about teaching, very 

interested in it, and are putting a lot of effort into their teaching at the time because they are 

making changes.  And, all of those things alone could make a really big difference in how 

effective a class is.  And, so to compare somebody who’s doing that to somebody who’s doing 

the usual same old same old with notes that they came up with ten years ago is not really valid.  

It’s not really fair.” (Mary 662-667) 

Example 3: PER studies are typically short term 

Many instructors appeared to view their job as teachers as one to prepare students to be 

successful after their course.  “My students I hope are well taught and the only proof of that is 

not in any test they take or anything else, its where they go and what they do afterwards.  That’s 

my bottom line.” (Terry 259-260)  They tended to criticize educational research for its lack of 

focus on the long term.  “I mean a big problem with a lot of the physics research I have is they 

never really track to see how it continues and so students who’ve had an interactive style 

teaching the beginning, how do they do as  seniors, how do they do on these standardized tests?  

How do they do as graduate students?  How does it trickle on up?” (Mary 658-661)

While the critiques these faculty raised have some validity, they can all be reasonably countered.  

For example, while some PER studies have been done comparing results of courses taught by 

PER researchers to courses taught by extreme traditionalists, there are many studies which 

compare innovations across comparable instructors and uphold previous findings.  The 

objections raised by our interviewees, while often true in a narrow frame generally fail to account 

for the ways in which the findings of PER have been replicated over time. 

Do faculty just need to be better informed about the nature of educational research and the ways 

in which the educational research community has in fact addressed many of their concerns?  We 

cannot fully answer this question from our data, but given the level of knowledge demonstrated 

by our interviewees about educational research we suspect that simple ignorance cannot 

completely explain the critiques.  It is impossible to conduct a research study to which no 

critique could be made.  It will always be possible that some alternative theory has not been fully 

discounted or that not all variables have been controlled for.  Ultimately it is up to the consumer 

of the research to decide whether or not to use the results.  If the consumer, for whatever reason, 

does not want to accept the results, he or she will be able to find a critique to justify this decision.    

As is often sarcastically noted by educational researchers, science faculty who are well versed in 

scientific thinking appear to value their intuitive thinking over scientific evidence when it comes 
to issues of teaching (see, for example Ref 9).  The theory of Cognitive Dissonance46 may be 

helpful in explaining this seemingly non-scientific rejection of many aspects of educational 

research.  According to the theory of cognitive dissonance and many empirical experiments 

based on this theory, humans can go to great lengths to avoid dissonance between their behavior 
and self-concept.47  Thus, for the instructors in this study to accept educational research in the 

way it is presented, they would have to also accept the idea that their prior teaching had 

significant deficits.  This threatens their self image as good teachers and is likely to be a 

particular issue for senior instructors who have spent most of their careers working under a 

traditional instructional paradigm.  One way out of the dissonance is to discredit the research.  

These thought processes, of course, happen at an unconscious level.   

Our speculation that the theory of cognitive dissonance is applicable here is supported by 

instructor statements discussed above in the section on “PER says I’m a bad teacher.”  While 

improvements can certainly be made in research methodology used by researchers and in the 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 17 of 37 

communication of this methodology to faculty, from a cognitive dissonance perspective this 

improved rigor will be unlikely to be significantly more convincing.  Faculty are human and 

react to the findings of research both intellectually and emotionally.  The research community 

has largely failed to acknowledge and address this emotional aspect to the reception of our work.     

Category IV: Faculty Want to Be Part of the Solution  

As a result of the way that these faculty perceive their interactions with educational researchers 

and the research results themselves, they tend to not make full use of research-based findings.  

They recognize that research has some good things to offer them and that researchers have 

expertise in teaching and learning that could be valuable.  Yet, they feel a need to be part of the 

solution themselves.  “I’ve spent my life doing this [teaching] and part of my teaching is in fact 

to be aware of all of the things that are going on [in educational research], but I want it to be 

useful and meaningful to that discourse.” (Terry 914-916).  This results in a situation where the 

primary way that these instructors pick the good from the bad is to use their own intuition and 

experience.  “I mean how much time I’m willing to devote to a technique that they’ve claimed 

they’ve shown does something, If I don’t feel that the method was scientific enough and that 

they’ve demonstrated that it was scientific, they haven’t given enough detail, I use much more my 

gut instinct.  Yes, this is something I think would work or No, I don’t think this is something that 

would work.” (Mary 677-681) 

All five instructors described the instructors’ personal style, preferences, and skills as being very 

important in determining appropriate teaching practices.  Thus, they did not expect any 

instructional package created elsewhere to work well for them with minimal or no modifications.  

This explains why, as described earlier, they did not follow the adoption model even in cases 

when they believed in the usefulness of the innovation.  What most of the instructors seem to 

describe as a desirable situation is some degree of reinvention where a change agent will work 

with them to decide on instructional practices that fit their individual situations.  This would be 

based on the instructors’ knowledge, skills, preferences, and teaching situation as well as on the 

available research knowledge about teaching and learning.  “I think what we ought to be doing is 

we ought to be talking to the teachers in the physics community about all of the possibilities, all 

of the ways in which students learn” (Terry 720-724)  “The blanket statement doesn’t hit me that 

some things are better than others because I think what you have to do in that statement is define 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 18 of 37 

which things are good and which things are bad and which teachers they are good and bad for 

and which students they are good and bad for.” (Terry 762-764)  One instructor, Harry, wanted 

to go even further.  He described his ideal situation as one of invention where PER would 

provide a coherent conceptual model of teaching and learning so faculty can make their own 

instructional decisions.  “There is a problem with physics education research … I don’t have a 

mental model of how students learn.  . . .If you claim that a certain optical phenomena occurs I 

can go to my office and calculate that and say, oh, yeah that can happen or no there is no 

possible way.  I have a good feel for the conditions under which that occurs.  I can’t do the same 

thing for students, for their learning.  I don’t have an intellectual framework around which to 

organize  innovations in teaching . . .So all I can do is to try and implement what I see in the 

literature as best practices.”  (Harry 95-101)  “So, how could PER be of more use to m, if you 

could come up with answers to questions like that.  What methods of presentation, be they textual 

or electronic, or whiz-bang, or whatever, what methods of presentation most effectuate learning.  

And what kinds of learning.  If I had a framework like that then I could answer my own 

questions. . . . OK, I want to do this.  Here’s how the experts tell me, here’s the things that the 

experts tell me I have to consider, OK I’ll consider it.” (Harry 612-620) 

VI. Discussion 

These faculty are aware of research-based products and generally agree with educational 

researchers about the problems those products are designed to solve.  There does not appear to be 

a difficulty with awareness.  The research community appears to have been effective in this level 

of communication.  The purposeful nature of this sample, however, should create caution in 

generalizing this result.  Several of the interviewees indicated that they had always been aware of 

the problems that the research-based curricula were designed to solve.  Thus, they may have been 

predisposed to pay attention to the research findings.  This would be consistent with the results of 
a study of the dissemination of educational research to mathematics faculty33 which concluded 

that “the only interviewees [math instructors] who were open to being persuaded by the 

dissemination materials were those who were already interested in or committed to the need for a 

reform but who were shopping around for the right approach.” (Ref 33, p.11)  Nonetheless, even 

though the instructors we interviewed may have started to pay attention to research findings 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 19 of 37 

because they were interested in reform, the research community appears to have sustained this 

interest.   

These faculty view educational researchers as expecting the change agent-instructor interaction 

to follow the adoption model.  Yet, they think that the most productive change agent-instructor 

interaction would be for researchers and faculty to work together under the reinvention or 

invention model.  In practice, though, faculty tended to work alone under the reinvention model.  

In some cases faculty reinvented instruction that was consistent with the original intention and/or 

recommendations in the research literature, but in many cases they reinvented instruction that 

was missing important fundamental features of the intended instruction and/or conflicted with 

recommended practices.  This isolation also meant that there was no sharing of successes or 

failures so that others could learn from them.  

Although this study was limited to a purposeful sample of five college physics instructors, many 

of the same themes were found by a different group of researchers in a study of a college biology 
instructor’s interactions with an instructional reform program.48  Quotes and analysis in the 

article exhibit some of the same emotional reactions to the instructor’s perception that change 

agents are telling her that there is only one good way to teach, that she is a bad teacher if she 

does not teach that way, and that her professional knowledge and experience are not valued.  

Ultimately, this instructor behaved similarly to the physics instructors described in this paper.  

She took some aspects of the reform ideas that she thought were useful and incorporated them 

into her preexisting instructional style while rejecting others (i.e., the reinvention mode).  She did 

not, though, make fundamental changes to an inquiry mode of instruction which was a primary 

goal of the reform program.  The presence of this phenomenon in a different context 

(instructional reform in college-level biology) suggests that the issue of divergent expectations 

between change agents and college science faculty may be broadly applicable.  Further research 

is needed to determine the extent of divergent expectations as a barrier to instructional change in 

the general population of science faculty. 

VII. Implications and Recommendations 

These faculty were a purposeful sample of the most likely users of educational research.  

Although there are individual cases where faculty have adopted a research product more or less 

as is, it is likely that the reinvention and invention tracks identified here are much more 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 20 of 37 

common.49  Faculty tended to work alone in their reinventions and inventions even though they 

would have liked to work more closely with the research community.  They all indicated that 

adoption wouldn’t work because of the personal nature of teaching and the unique instructional 

environments.  Many instructors also offered a more emotional reason – that they felt researchers 

implied they were a bad teacher and did not recognize the value of their work and experience.  
This issue of ‘face’ has come up in the research literature on dissemination of innovations.50 

It appears that the educational research community may have a broader impact on actual teaching 

practices by more fully embracing a mode of interaction with traditional faculty based on 

cooperation, respect, and support.  Instructors are not simply “teaching technicians,” they want 

to, and should be included as active participants in the development process.  Before we can help 

faculty to reinvent/invent, we must first gain a better understanding of the conditions under 

which this can be done successfully and make this understanding an explicit part of the 

dissemination process.  In this section we offer some speculative recommendations about how 

the research community might begin to move in this direction.   

Recommendations  

Recommendation 1: Provide easily modifiable materials. 

Moving towards the invention side of the adoption-invention continuum means that instructional 

materials and designs should be developed with the expectation that faculty will engage in local 

customization.  Faculty should be treated as participants in the development process and should 

be given the opportunity to adopt materials for their local environment.  In addition, providing 

instructors with easily modifiable materials communicates to them that they can and should use 

their own expertise to appropriately integrate the materials into their unique teaching situations.  

One example is a project recently undertaken by Andy Elby and the University of Maryland 

Physics Education Research Group that encourages and supports customization through easily 

edited materials along with explanations about the instructional design and annotated video 
snippets of the materials and techniques in actual classroom use.51 

Recommendation 2: Disseminate and research ideas in addition to curriculum.  

If faculty are going to modify curriculum effectively, they need to understand both what works 

(details) as well as why it works (principles).  For example, while many physics faculty now have 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Henderson and Dancy, Divergent Expectations 

 

Page 21 of 37 

a copy of Mazur’s Peer Instruction19 and may have begun using some of the associated 

conceptual questions, they are less aware of the research evidence that learning is primarily a 
social activity52 and, so, tend to drop the peer-peer interaction part of Peer Instruction.54  Without 

an understanding of the social importance of learning, it is then easy for an instructor to reinvent 

peer instruction in a way that is likely to reduce its effectiveness.  On the other hand, once an 

instructor does understand the importance of social interactions for learning, they are more likely 

to incorporate this aspect into their own reinventions or inventions.   

In order to provide faculty with the details and principles knowledge, the educational research 

community will need to better understand and clearly articulate why a curriculum is successful 

and not just document its success at one, or a handful, or institutions.   

Recommendation 3:  Explicitly research the conditions for transfer.  

It is not uncommon for curriculum to be produced and disseminated that has not been tested in 

contexts beyond the environment in which it was developed.  Most research-based curricula has 

been developed at research universities or elite liberal arts colleges.  However, both conventional 
wisdom and available evidence27,55,56 suggest that these curricula do not always transfer directly 

to other environments.  In order for dissemination to be successful we suggest that curriculum 

development efforts: (1) test and refine curriculum in environments fundamentally different from 

the development site; (2) attempt to make explicit what aspects of the curriculum will transfer 

and under what conditions the transfer will be successful; (3) make recommendations for 

modifications in different contexts, for example, how the curriculum could be modified for 

different sized classes, or for schools with less prepared students; (4) articulate why some aspects 

transfer better than others to guide instructors in their modifications.  Understanding the whys 

behind transfer issues is also essential for building a general model to guide future development 

projects. 

Recommendation 4: View faculty as partners.  

When disseminating educational innovations, the research community should focus on working 

with faculty as partners, either individually or in small groups to improve instructional practices 

in individual situations.  Under this framework faculty would be recognized as a valuable part of 

this process with learning occurring on both sides.  This is in contrast to current dissemination

activities describing deficiencies with traditional instructional practices, providing polished 

ready-to-use curricula, and having change agents promote only the curricula that they developed.   

While constructivist principles are well recognized and supported for students learning physics, 

these same ideals are often replaced by a “teaching by telling” approach to dissemination.  Not 

only are the general beliefs, previous experiences, and intuitions of instructors important 

influences in the way they integrate new approaches, their expertise is also valuable and should 

be recognized as such.  Such an approach would avoid the issues of face and cognitive 

dissonance because it would use the instructor’s current instruction as a starting point for 

constructing new instruction as opposed to requiring the instructor to first reject his/her current 
instruction.  There are many ways to do this, ranging from one-on-one interaction57-59 to more 
formally organized groups of faculty interested in improving their instruction.60-62 

Recommendation 5: Acknowledge that change is difficult and support, rather than blame 

instructors.  

Many of the reforms suggested by educational research are difficult to implement.  Yet, many 

innovations are presented as if significant improvements are possible by following the “simple” 

suggestions of the curriculum developer.  In reality, it is common for instructors to try and 

integrate a new research-based idea into their teaching without a noticeable improvement in 

instruction.  Often, the reforms fail in large part because of situational constraints.  For example, 

most research-based curricula require students to interact with each other.  However, giving 

students the opportunity to speak in class slows down the pace creating a difficulty for instructors 

without the ability to reduce the content that is covered.  Also, if students do not talk to each 

other in any other courses they may be particularly resistant, creating an atmosphere that resists 

the innovation. 

Educational structures have developed around and in support of traditional instructional 
practices.14  Reformed instruction is necessarily instruction that in some way challenges the 

status-quo.  The greater the challenge to the status-quo the innovation represents, the greater the 

resistance that can be expected.  Too often, an instructor may try an innovation and then blame 

the method for the poor results.  In return, it is common for the research community to blame the 

instructor for the failure. Rather than viewing failed implementations as entirely the fault of the 

implementers, it would be useful for the research community to acknowledge how difficult real 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Page 23 of 37 

and sustained change can be, and to identify and articulate the situational factors that make such 

change difficult.  In addition, instructors should be made aware of these difficulties so they can 

better work to overcome them.  Finally, the research community should provide supportive 

structures to help faculty to cope with the barriers they are likely to encounter as they try to make 

improvements in their instruction.

TABLE 1: Instructional problems discussed by interviewees during interview. 

 

Instructional Problem 

Students don’t get much from traditional lecture.  
Different kinds of students learn differently. 
Students have misconceptions that are not simple to change. 
Many students have poor problem solving skills. 
Assessment difficulties – getting the right answer to a problem does not 
mean that a student understands. 
In teaching, it is helpful to tailor explanations to individual students, but 
this is difficult/impossible in a large class 
Students have great difficulty learning the basic concepts of physics

Adoption 

Adaptation 

Reinvention 

Invention 

 

The instructor uses 
the ideas or materials 
of the change agent 
but changes them 
significantly (i.e., 
changes a principle) 
or develops 
fundamentally new 
procedures or 
materials based on the 
change agent ideas. 

The instructor 
develops materials 
and procedures that 
are fundamentally 
based on his/her own 
ideas. 

The change agent 
develops all of the 
materials and 
procedures and gives 
them to the instructor 
to implement as is. 

The change agent 
develops the materials 
and procedures and 
gives them to the 
instructor who 
modifies some of the 
details before 
implementation.
