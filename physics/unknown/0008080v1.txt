Abstract

This  paper reports on  the  feasibility  study of  a  proton
Super-Conducting Linac (SCL)  as  a  new  injector  to  the
Alternating  Gradient  Synchrotron 
the
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The Linac beam
energy  is  in  the  range  of  1.5  to  2.4  GeV.  The  beam
intensity is adjusted to provide an average beam power of
4 MW at the top energy of 24 GeV. The repetition rate of
the SCL-AGS facility is 5 beam pulses per second.

1      INTRODUCTION

It  has  been  proposed  to  upgrade  the  AGS  accelerator
complex to  provide an average  proton  beam  power  of  4
MW  at  the  energy of  24  GeV.  The  facility  can  be  used
either  as  a  proton  driver  for  the  production  of  intense
muon and neutrino beams, or/and as  a pulsed high-energy
spallation  neutron source. The upgrade requires  operation
of the accelerator at the rate of  five cycles per second, and
a new injector for an increase of  the  AGS  beam intensity
by a factor of three.

In  a separate technical report [1] we have described the
methods  and  the  requirements  to  operate  the  BNL-AGS
accelerator facility at the rate of 5  proton  beam pulses  per
second.  The  major  requirement  is  an  extensive  addition
and modification of  the  present power supply  system.  At
the  same  time,  a  new  injector  to  the  AGS,  capable  to
operate at  the  rate  of  5  beam  pulses  per  second,  and  to
provide a three-fold increase of the present beam intensity,
is  required.  The  present  injector  made  of  the  200-MeV
Linac and of  the  1.5-GeV AGS-Booster will  not  be  able
to fulfill the goals of the upgrade.

The  proposed  new  injector  is  a  1.5  -  2.4  GeV  SCL
with an average output beam power of 250 - 400 kW. The
largest energy is  determined by  the  need to  control  beam
losses  due to  stripping  of  the  negative ions  that  are used
for multi-turn  injection  into  the  synchrotron.  The  high-
energy case is  to  be preferred if  one  wants  to  reduce  the
effects  of  space  charge,  for  a  sufficiently  small  beam
transverse  size  that  fits  the  AGS  acceptance.  The  duty
cycle is about a half percent.

The paper describes the preliminary design of  the  SCL.
It is composed of three parts; a front end, that  is  a 60-mA
negative-ion source, followed by  a 5-MeV RFQ,  a  room
temperature  Drift-Tube  Linac  (DTL) 
that  accelerates
protons to 150 MeV, and the SCL proper.  This  in  turn  is
made of  four  sections,  each  with  its  own  energy  range,

and  different  cavity-cryostat  arrangement.  The 
four
sections  are  labeled:  Low-Energy  (LE),  Medium  Low-
Energy (MLE),  Medium High-Energy (MHE), and  High-
Energy (HE).

2      THE  NEW  INJECTOR

The two  different  Linac  energy  cases  are  compared  in
Table 1.  AGS  performance during multi-turn  injection  is
also summarized in the same Table. Both cases correspond
to the same average beam current of  0.17  mA,  that  yields
the same average beam power of 4  MW  at  the  top  energy
of  24  GeV.  The  repetition  rate  of  5  beam  pulses  per
second  is  assumed  in  both  cases;  that  gives  the  same
intensity of 2.1 x 1014 protons  accelerated per AGS  cycle;
that  is  a  factor  of  3  higher  then  the  intensity  routinely
obtained with the present injector. At the end of  injection,
that  takes  about  317-330  turns,  the  space-charge  tune
depression is D
= 0.2  at  2.4  GeV, assuming  a bunching  factor (the  ratio
of beam peak current to  average current), during the  early
part of  the  acceleration cycle, of  4.  Also,  with  the  same
normalized beam emittance of 250 p
 mm-mrad, the  actual
beam emittance is  smaller at  2.4  GeV, e
  mm-
mrad, versus 104    p
  mm-mrad  at  1.5  GeV.  Obviously,
the  effective acceptance of  the  AGS  at  injection  is  to  be
larger than these beam emittance values.

 = 0.4 at the  energy of  1.5  GeV, and D

    =  73  p

The  front-end  of  the  Linac  is  made  of  an  ion  source
operating with a 1% duty cycle at  the  repetition rate of  5
pulses per second. The beam current within  a pulse  is  60
mA of negative-hydrogen ions. The ion  source seats on  a
platform  at  35-60  kVolt,  and  is  followed  by  a  5-MeV
RFQ  that  works  at  201.25  MHz.  The  beam  is  pre-
chopped by a chopper located between the  ion  source and
the  RFQ.  The beam  chopping  extends  over  75%  of  the
beam length,  at  a frequency  matching  the  accelerating  rf
(4.11-4.28  MHz)  at  injection  into  the  AGS.  Moreover,
the  transmission  efficiency  through  the  RFQ  is  taken
conservatively to  be 80%,  so  that  the  average  current  of
the beam pulse in the  Linac,  where we assume no  further
beam loss, is 36 mA.

The combination  of  the  chopper and  of  the  RFQ  pre-
bunches the  beam with  a  sufficiently  small  longitudinal
extension  so  that  each  of  the  beam  bunches  can  be
entirely  fitted  in 
the  accelerating  rf  buckets  of  the
following DTL that operates at either 402.5  or  805  MHz.
The DTL is  a room  temperature conventional  Linac  that
accelerates to 150 MeV.

3      THE  SUPER-CONDUCTING  LINAC
The SCL accelerates the proton beam from 150 MeV to
1.5  or  2.4  GeV.  The  configuration  and  the  design
procedure of  the  SCL  is  described  in  detail  in  [2].  It  is
typically  a sequence of  a  number  of  identical  periods  as
shown in Figure 1. Each period is  made of  a cryo-module
of  length  Lcryo  and  of  an  insertion  of  length  Lins.  The
insertion  is  needed  for 
the  placement  of  focusing
quadrupoles,  vacuum  pumps,  steering  magnets,  beam
diagnostic devices, bellows and flanges. It can be either at
room  temperature  or  in  a  cryostat  as  well.  Here  we
assume that  the  insertions  are  at  room  temperature.  The
cryo-module  includes  M  identical  cavities,  each  of  N
identical cells, and each having a length NLcell, where L cell
is  the  length  of  a  cell.  Cavities  are  separated  from  each
other by a drift space d. An extra drift of length Lw may be
added  internally  on  both  sides  of  the  cryo-module  to
provide a transition between cold and warm regions. Thus,
Lcryo   =    MN  Lcell   +  (M   -

 1) d    +   2 Lw 

  (1)

There  are  two  symmetric  intervals:  a  minor  one,
between  the  two  middle  points  A  and  B,  as  shown  in
Figure 1, that is the interval of a cavity of length  NL cell  +
d; and a major one, between the  two  middle points  C  and
D, that defines the range of a period of total length  Lcryo  +
Lins. Thus, the topology of a period can be represented as a
drift of  length  g,  followed  by  M  cavity  intervals,  and  a
final drift of length g, where
g     =    Lw    +    (Lins -

 d ) / 2   

  (2)

The  choice  of  cryo-modules  with  identical  geometry,
and with the same cavity/cell configuration, is economical
and convenient for construction. But there is,  nonetheless,
a  penalty  due  to  the  reduced  transit-time-factors  when  a
particle  crosses  cavity  cells,  with  length  adjusted  to  a
common  central value b 0 that  does not  correspond to  the

particle  instantaneous  velocity.  To  minimize  this  effect
the SCL is  divided in  four sections,  each designed around
a different central value  b 0,  and,  therefore,  with  different
cavity/cell configuration. The cell length  in  a  section  is
fixed to be
Lcell     =     l
where    l
  is  the  rf  wavelength.  We  assume  the  same
operating frequency of  805  MHz  for  the  entire  SCL,  so
that  l  = 37.24 cm.

0 / 2 

  (3)

The major parameters of  the  four sections  of  the  SCL
are given in Tables 2 and 4.  Transverse focussing is  done
with  a sequence of  FODO  cells with  half-length equal to
that  of  a period. The phase advance  per  cell  is  90o.  The
rms  normalized  betatron  emittance  is  0.3  p
  mm-mrad.
The rms bunch area is 0.5 p
  oMeV.  The rf phase angle is
30o.  The  cost  estimate  (with  no  contingency)  for  each
section of the SCL  has  been made assuming  the  cost  and
rf parameters shown in Table 3. The total expected cost  is
around  300  M$,  including  also  the  front-end  and  the
room-temperature DTL.

The  length  of  the  Linac  depends  on  the  average
accelerating gradient. The local gradient  has  a  maximum
value that is limited by  three causes: (1) The surface field
limit at the frequency of the 805 MHz is 26 MV/m.  For  a
realistic cavity shape, we set a limit of a 13 MV/m on  the
axial  electric  field.  (2)  There  is  a  limit  on  the  power
provided by  rf  couplers  that  we  take  here  not  to  exceed
400  kW,  including  a  contingency  of  50%  to  avoid
saturation  effects.  (3)  To  make  the  longitudinal  motion
stable, we can only apply an energy gain  per cryo-module
that  is  a relatively small  fraction of  the  beam  energy  in
exit  of  the  cryo-module.  The  conditions  for  stability  of
motion have been derived in [2].

The  proposed  mode  of  operation  is  to  operate  each
section of the SCL with the same rf input power per  cryo-
module. This  will  result  to  some  variation  of  the  actual
axial  field  from  one  cryo-module  to  the  next.  If  one
requires also a constant value of  the  axial field, this  may
be obtained by adjusting locally the value of the rf phase.

The number of  cells and cavities varies from  insertion
to  insertion.  The number  of  couplers  varies  for  1  to  2.
The total length of the injector including the front-end and
the DTL is expected to be about 500 meters.

It  is  proposed to  build the  entire  SCL  in  two  stages.
During the first stage the final energy if 1.5  GeV, and the
Linac is made of the three first sections. In  a second stage
the  High-Energy section is  added  for  the  final  energy  of
2.4 GeV, if indeed this should result to be necessary.

Negative ion  stripping  during transport down the  SCL
has been found to be very negligible. But a final 30o bend,
before injection into the  AGS,  could be of  a concern [3].
To  control the  rate of  beam  loss  by  stripping  to  a  10-4
level, the bending field should not exceed 2.6 kGauss over
a total integrated bending length of 15 m,  in  the  1.5  GeV
case. At  2.4  GeV, the  bending field is  1.9    kGauss,  and
the integrated bending length about 30 m.

There are two problems  in  the  case of  the  pulsed-mode
of  operation of  the  SCL.  First,  there  are  Lorentz  forces
that deform the cavity cells out of resonance. They can be
controlled  with  a  thick  cavity  wall  strengthened  to  the
outside  by  supports.  Second,  there  is  an  appreciable
period of time to fill the cavities with  rf power before the
maximum  gradient    is  reached  [2].  During  the  filling
time,  extra  power  is  dissipated  also  before  the  beam  is
