Abstract

"Single-shot"  ultrafast  spectroscopy  based  on  the  frequency  encoding  of  transient

absorbance  kinetics  using  chirped  probe  pulses  is  analyzed  theoretically.  FDSS  has  an

advantage  over  pump-probe  spectroscopy  in  a  situation  where  the  "noise"  is  dominated  by

amplitude variations of the signal. Unlike "single-shot" techniques based on spatial encoding of

the  kinetics,  no  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  excitation  profile  of  the  pump  is  needed.  FDSS

spectroscopy can be used for many types of samples, liquid or solid, including those comparable

in  thickness  to  the  wavelength  of  the  probe  light.  Another  advantage  is  that  due  to  the

interference  of  quasimonochromatic  components  of  the  chirped  probe  pulse,  an  oscillation

pattern near the origin of the FDSS kinetics emerges. This interference pattern is unique and can

be used to determine the complex dielectric function of the photogenerated species.

I. INTRODUCTION

Most ultrafast laser spectroscopy experiments are done in a pump-probe fashion:

a short probe pulse is delayed in time and then crossed in the sample with a pump pulse.

The kinetics are obtained by plotting the transmission/reflection of the probe pulse as a

function of the delay time, point by point. If the amplitude of the photoinduced signal

varies from shot to shot or the sample is unstable (e.g., a high-speed jet), this variation

translates  into  "noise"  that  is  spread  across  the  whole  trace.  The  acquisition  could  be

considerably shortened if there were a reliable method for "single-shot" sampling of the

kinetics.  Since  the  entire  kinetic  traces  would  modulate  in  the  same  way,  shot-to-shot

variations would not produce "noise" and the averaging efficiency would improve. Our

interest  in  this  "single-shot"  methodology  was  instigated  by  the  development  of  an
ultrafast high energy electron source for radiation chemistry studies at Argonne. 1 Due to
the high power load on the amplification optics, the repetition rate is rather low, < 5 Hz. 1

Owing to large shot-to-shot variations in the yield of electrons and this low repetition

rate, pump-probe spectroscopy (PPS) is unsuited for this kind of electron source.

Two  approaches  for  "single-shot"  ultrafast  spectroscopy  have  been  previously

suggested:  (i)  spatial  encoding  and  (ii)  frequency  encoding.  The  former  method  was
proposed by Rentzepis and coworkers 2,3 and further developed by Nelson and coworkers.
4,5,6    The  method  is  similar  in  principle  to  the  one  used  in  frequency-resolved  optical
gating (FROG) devices.  7  In  a  typical  setup,  4,5 cylindrically focussed pump and probe

beams  are  crossed  in  the  sample,  and  the  transmitted  probe  and  reference  beams  are

imaged on a charge coupled device (CCD) array. Since the arrival time of the probe pulse

at the sample continuously changes across the beam (on a sub-ps time scale), the pump

and probe collide at different times and this "imprints" the kinetics on the axial profile of

the transmitted light. The spread of the delay times can be increased further out to 10-15
ps by passing the probe (and/or the pump) beam through an echelon  3.6 or a supersonic
beam.  8  Transient  absorption  (TA),  2,4,5,6  stimulated emission,  3  and  grating  5
measurements  on  picosecond  (ps)  2,3 and  femtosecond  (fs)  4,5 time  scales  have  been

carried out in this manner. A more sophisticated version of the same technique employs

3

two crossed echelons to generate a two dimensional array of probe pulses separated by 30
fs  in  time  that  extends  out  to  10  ps.  6    While  spatial  encoding  may  work  for  some

applications,  there  are  several  drawbacks  that  make  this  technique  unsuitable  for  time

resolved radiation chemistry:

First, it is almost impossible to extend the time window of the observation beyond

the first 10-15 ps. Second, refraction of the probe and pump beams, by liquid jets and

thermal  lenses,  is  a  serious  concern,  as  it  destroys  the  written  pattern.  For  thin  films,

interference of the probe beam in the sample ruins the spatio-temporal correlation, and
there are no examples of using the technique for samples thinner than 100 µm. Third, to

obtain  the  spatial  profile  of  the  probe  beam,  one  needs  to  know  the  spatial  profile  of
photogenerated species, 4,5 as it is the product of these two profiles that is registered by

the  detector.  To  this  end,  a  separate  experiment  with  a  calibrated  sample  is  needed  to
obtain  the  pump  beam  profile.  4  If  the  photon  order  of  the  excitation  is  not  known

beforehand  or  the  excitation  is  mixed  order,  the  knowledge  of  such  a  profile  is

insufficient. Finally, it is impossible to focus the ultrashort pulse of relativistic electrons

cylindrically or delay this pulse in time without substantial increase in its pulse duration,
due to the energy spread. 1 From the engineering prospective, spatio-temporal encoding

requires extremely high quality of the light beams and close placement of the detector to

the sample, which makes it difficult to use this method in the confined space of a vacuum

chamber.

The second technique, frequency encoding, is based on introducing frequency-
dependent phase (i.e., chirp) in the probe pulse. 9,10 Frequency encoding has been used for
"single-shot" temporal and spatio-temporal characterization of short light  11,12 and  free
electron 13 pulses, correlation spectroscopy, 14 holography, 15a interferometry, 16,17 electro-
optic measurements of THz pulses, 15b etc. This encoding is implicit in the pump-probe
spectroscopies that use chirped laser pulses, including transient absorption, 18.19 reflection,
19 interferometry, 17 and 4-wave mixing.20 In 1992, Beddard et al. 10 suggested a chirped
pulse  TA  spectroscopy in  which  the  frequency  encoding  is  used  for  "single-shot"

frequency domain  detection  of  kinetics,  by  spectral  analysis  of  the  transmitted  probe

light.  In  the  following,  this  method  is  referred  to  as  frequency-domain  "single-shot"

4

(FDSS) spectroscopy. Briefly, a linear chirp is introduced in the probe pulse. Since the

blue light component of the chirped probe pulse arrives at the sample at a different delay

time than the red light component, the absorption of these components by photogenerated

species depends on their frequency, and the TA kinetics is imprinted in the spectrum of

the transmitted probe pulse, with the "delay time" equal to the group delay at a given

frequency. This technique can be used only for species whose TA spectra are either flat

over  the  bandwidth  of  the  probe  pulse  or  known  beforehand.  Importantly,  in  FDSS

spectroscopy, the probe light is not combined with the reference light at a spectrometer,
as  occurs  in  "single-shot"  interferometry.  16,17  In  the  latter  method,  the  kinetics  are
obtained by the Fourier transform of the resulting interferogram.  16    This makes FDSS

kinetics simpler to obtain and analyze.

In the decade that passed after the experiments of Beddard et al., 10 generation of

ultrashort  pulses  using  chirped-pulse  amplification  (CPA)  with  grating  stretchers  and
compressors  became  routine.  9  The  femtosecond  pulses  derived  from  a  mode-locked

Ti:sapphire laser provide the bandwidth that is optimum for FDSS measurements. Due to

their high quality, these pulses can be negatively chirped using grating compressors that
provide group velocity dispersion (GVD) up to a few ps2.  9    As argued below, with the

typical compressor designs that are used for CPA, "single-shot" kinetic measurements on

the sub-nanosecond time scale are possible.

With  these  developments,  FDSS  has  the  potential  to  become  a  mainstream

technique.  In  refs.  21  and  22  we  demonstrated  the  advantages  of  FDSS  for  several

photosystems,  both  solid  and  liquid.  A  variable-length  grating  compressor  is  used  to

change the observation window (by changing the GVD) over two decades in time. The

proposed method bypasses most of the problems associated with spatial encoding and is

easy to implement experimentally. In this paper, we give a detailed theoretical analysis of

the  FDSS  technique  as  implemented  in  refs.  21  and  22.  In  Sec.  II,  an  infinitely  thin

sample is considered. The more complex case of a sample of finite thickness (which may

be  comparable  to  the  wavelength  of  the  probe  light)  is  examined  in Appendix A.  The

requirements of the optics used for FDSS spectroscopy are discussed briefly in Sec. III;

most of the technical details are given in Appendix B in the Supplement. d) To save space,

some  figures  (referred  to  in  the  text  as,  for  example,  Fig.  1S)  are  also  placed  in  the

to take the maximum advantage of the spectral range (where  s > 0 for a stretched pulse

; in this case the oscillations are almost completely eliminated (Fig. 3).

To the same end, one can reduce the spectral resolution δ so that  δτ

> 1 (Fig. 3). If the

GVD

oscillation pattern of  S(

)ω  is of interest (e.g., for the measurement of  ∆nω), one needs to

minimize both τ

L and δ.

Fig.  4  shows  the  real  part  of  function  Φ  (eq.  (14))  for  τ

= 20   and  several

fs

stretch factors s. For picosecond kinetics (s=100), 30-50% of the time window is taken by

the  oscillation  pattern;  for  larger  GVD,  this  fraction  decreases  as  s

−1 2/ .  The  observed

trends agree with the qualitative analysis given above and the experimental results in refs.

21 and 22. Fig. 5 shows the progression of signals S(ω) as a function of the phase  φε for

∆n

ω

=

const

ω
(

) . Observe how the oscillation pattern near the kinetic origin changes with

the  phase;  this  dependence  may  be  used  to  estimate  φε  from  the  general  shape  of  the

oscillatory pattern (see ref. 21 for experimental demonstration of such a measurement).

For  ∆nω   that  spectrally  evolves  in  time  this  pattern  reflects  the  average  phase  over  a

12

period  of  time  ∼τ

GVD.  By  changing  GVD,  one  can  obtain  the  time  dependence  of  this

average phase.

III. EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS.

As compared to CPA, FDSS sets very modest constraints on the compressor or

stretcher used to chirp the probe pulse. In the usual CPA scheme, 9  a short pulse from the

oscillator is stretched, amplified, and then compressed, so that the positive chirp added by

the  stretcher  and  the  amplifier  optics  is  cancelled  by  the  negative  chirp  added  by  the

compressor.  Therefore,  to  obtain  a  transform  limited,  ultrashort  pulse,  this  scheme

requires compensation of third (TOD) and higher order dispersion. In the FDSS, TOD

and the higher orders are unimportant because for the standard beam geometry, a grating

compressor/stretcher cannot introduce sufficiently large TOD to cause notable distortion

of the kinetics. For a single round-trip between the pair of parallel gratings, the GVD is

given by 9

(that corresponds to the Littrow angle dispersion of 800 nm probe light by a 1200 g/mm

grating in the first diffraction order). While the TOD shifts the kinetic origin, the change

in  the  kinetic  profile  is  very  slight.  Furthermore,  this  small  change  can  be  completely

eliminated by plotting the kinetics as a function of the group delay Te defined by eq. (32),

as shown in Fig. 1S(b).

Another important point is that the probe beam dispersed on the grating can be

clipped by the grating edges. In CPA, the spectral wings cannot be clipped because the

high-frequency  components  must  be  added  to  prevent  oscillations  of  the  compressed

pulse in the time domain. 9  By contrast, in FDSS, the kinetics are imprinted in the central

section of the probe spectrum and Fourier components outside this section simply do not

matter.  This  point  is  demonstrated  by  numerical  simulations  in  Appendix  B.1  in  the

Supplement. d) According to this analysis, for the same stretch factor, the gratings in the

FDSS setup can be placed 3-5 times further away than the gratings in the equivalent CPA

design.  This  calculation  suggests  that  with  the  standard  CPA  optics,  one  can  readily

sample the kinetics over 300-500 ps.

Since  the  spectral  range  and  resolution  are  fixed  by  the  choice  of  the

monochromator and detector, to obtain the kinetics on different time scales, GVD must

be tuned over the widest possible range. To this end, a variable-length grating compressor

is best suited. 21,22  In the FDSS setup described in ref. 21,  the probe pulse is taken from

the 800 nm light, positively chirped using a fixed-length Lg=40 cm grating stretcher, and

14

then  negatively  chirped  using  a  variable-length  compressor.  A  separate  fixed-length

compressor is used to generate a transform-limited, amplified 800 nm pulse that provides

the pump light. This scheme allows for continuous change in the probe GVD between 0

and -1.6 ps2. Inexpensive gratings can be used, as large power losses can be tolerated due

to high intensity of the probe light. For the same reason, higher diffraction orders m can

be used to increase GVD without changing Lg (eq. (30)).

The  greatest  inconvenience  presented  by  the  FDSS  technique  is  that  the  probe

color  cannot  be  easily  changed.  A  strategy  of  overcoming  this  deficiency,  by  using

compressor  gratings  in  higher  order,  is  given  in  Appendix  B.2  in  the  Supplement.

Another practical concern, nonideality of the probe pulse (i.e., the deviation of its power

spectrum from an ideal Gaussian profile), turns out to be of relatively little significance

for FDSS spectroscopy, as discussed in Appendix B.3 in the Supplement.

IV. CONCLUSION.

Ultrafast  frequency-encoded  "single-shot"  transient  absorption  spectroscopy

(FDSS) is analyzed theoretically within the framework of a generalized treatment given

in Sec. II. It is shown that interference of quasimonochromatic components of the chirped

probe pulse introduces an oscillatory pattern near the kinetic origin with a time period

comparable to the square root of the GVD (τ

GVD). The fraction of FDSS kinetics that is

modulated  by  these  oscillations  decreases  as  s

−1 2/   with  the  increase  in  the  absolute

stretch/compression  factor  s  of  the  probe  pulse.  For  long-lived  FDSS  signals,  this

oscillatory pattern can be used to estimate the phase of the complex dielectric function.

Due  to  the  practical  importance  of  thin-film  semiconductors,  a  more  general

formulation of our approach for such samples is given in Appendix A; the correctness of

this general approach is demonstrated experimentally in ref. 22. In refs. 21 and 22, the

15

theoretical results of Sec. II and Appendix A are used to interpret experimental FDSS

kinetics  for  photoinduced  charge  separation  in  molecular  liquids  and  semiconductor

solids.

The  experimental  concerns  regarding  the  use  of  variable  length  grating

compressor for chirping the probe pulse for FDSS spectroscopy are addressed in Sec. III.

As  shown  there,  standard  optics  used  for  chirped  pulse  amplification  can  be  used  to

extend  the  time  window  of  FDSS  to  300-500  ps.  These  FDSS  kinetics  can  be  spliced

together to obtain even longer time profiles. 21   In this respect, and in the ability to vary

the observation window over two decades in time, FDSS is superior to the methods based

on  spatio-temporal  encoding  (Sec.  I).  The  only  strict  requirement  imposed  by  the

technique  on  the  probe  pulse  is  that  the  spectrum  should  be  reasonably  close  to  a

Gaussian.  Still,  a  "ripple"  pattern  with  peak-to-peak  amplitude  of  10-20%  can  be

tolerated (Appendix B.3). With regard to the time resolution, the main shortcoming of

FDSS  spectroscopy  is  that  the  kinetics  shorter  than  a  few  picoseconds  exhibit  strong

oscillations and may be of limited use without analysis. For applications where amplitude

variations  of  the  kinetics  are  large,  absorption  spectra  of  photogenerated  species  are

broad  and  featureless,  repetition  rates  are  low,  and  subpicosecond  resolution  is

unimportant, FDSS has a clear advantage over pump-probe spectroscopy and many other

"single-shot" spectroscopies.

Appendix A. Arbitrary thickness sample on a clear substrate.

In  this  Appendix,  a  general  case  of  the  probe  light  propagating  through  a  thin

sample is examined. Without loss of generality, we will assume that the sample is a flat

layer of thickness d with a complex dielectric function  εω

ω= n2  on a thick, non-absorbing

substrate with index of refraction ns. The propagation of light through the sample in the

direction normal to the surface is given by a wave equation

where  z  is  the  depth  of  the  sample  (z=0  for  the  air/sample  interface  and  z=d for the

function by the pump light. We will assume that this perturbation is independent of z, i.e.,

the  pump  light  is  absorbed  homogeneously  throughout  the  sample  (if  the  energy

deposition  is  z-dependent,  even  the  PPS  experiment  becomes  difficult  to  analyze

rigorously). 24   To solve eq. (A1) we will use first order perturbation theory and assume

1. Clipping of dispersed pulse.

To  demonstrate  the  invariance  of  FDSS  kinetics  to  clipping  of  the  probe  pulse
dispersed on the compressor grating, eq. (12) was used to calculate S(ω) for a probe pulse
whose Gaussian spectrum was truncated at  ∆ω

p  (Fig. 2S). It is clear from this

≈ ±1/

τ

calculation that the effect of truncation is limited to narrow regions near the truncation

points. This is explained as follows:

The clipping of the spectrum is equivalent to narrowing the integration interval

(
over Ω (or µ) in eq. (12). The integral function is damped as  exp −

{
µ τ
2

L

+

τ

)
}
2

, and

for τL=100 fs pump and τp=20 fs probe the Gaussian envelope is 160 cm-1 FWHM. If the

kinetic origin is removed from the truncation points by that much, the cutoff has no effect
(
on the oscillation pattern. In general, the effect of limiting µ to a range of  −
equivalent to introducing an additional damping factor  exp −(
(given by eqs. (15) and (20)) by Μ -2. For instance, a bandpass of ±10 cm-1 is equivalent
to  increasing  τL  to  1  ps.  Thus,  a  few  picoseconds  away  from  the  kinetic  origin,  the
truncation of the probe pulse has no effect since a very narrow band of the frequencies Ω

)

contributes to  S(

)ω  in the first place. Only for very low GVD (s of ±(10-50)) can the

truncation distort the kinetics. However, for those GVD's, the spread of the beam on the

gratings is small and no clipping occurs anyway. This consideration indicates that once
the  kinetic  origin  is  removed  by  100-200  cm-1  from  the  clipping  points,  the  kinetics

(including the oscillation pattern) do not change at all.

Concerning the dispersion achievable using the standard CPA optics, a τp=20 fs

(33 fs FWHM), 800 nm pulse from a Ti:sapphire oscillator yields an optimum sampling
interval (eq. (29)) of ±250 cm-1. Simple estimates show that for the standard 1200 g/mm
(θL= 28.7o), 11 cm - wide reflection grating used in the first order, the distance Lg can be
increased to 1.5-2 m without adverse effects on the FDSS kinetics: For θ=40o and Lg=1
)
0 =-3 ps2 (s=-7650,  ξ3=1.34),  and  the  ±250  cm-1 interval would be dispersed

′′(
φ ω

m, 

over 4.5 cm.

The use of smaller stretch factors (<103) and longer probe pulses (> 200 fs) might
be preferable to compressing a 10-50 fs pulse by a large factor of -(1-10)x103, as done in
our experiments.  21 However,  since  the  oscillations  take  ≈ 1

s   of  the  total  kinetics

regardless  of  the  probe  pulse  width,  larger  GVD  and  shorter  pulses  actually  yield

"cleaner" TA traces, even for relatively long sampling times. Furthermore, resolving the

oscillation pattern requires short pump pulses and, therefore, short probe pulses. In the

end, the only advantage of longer probe pulses is the possibility of stretching these pulses

with optical fibers.

Since  it  is  impossible  to  place  large  reflection  gratings  (needed  to  obtain  large

GVD) closer than 15-20 cm, due to the beam geometry, an equivalent positive chirp has

to  be  introduced  prior  to  the  compression,  as  done  in  ref. 21. Alternative schemes for
obtaining small stretch/compression factors (102-103) (other than slight overcompression

of stretched pulses, as done in ref. 21) may include the use of transmission gratings (that
can be put close to each other and, thereby, give the widest dynamic range), a)  dispersive
materials (such as SF18 glass), 9 and optical fibers (especially for visible light).  10    For

instance, SF18 glass has GVD of 1540 fs2/cm at 800 nm (s=+3.85/cm, ξ3=0.5)  9    and a

stretch factor of +100 can be achieved by passing a transform limited probe pulse through
25 cm of this material. Beddard et al. 10  used a 2.5 m long single mode optical fiber to
obtain a GVD of 0.14 ps2 to perform their first FDSS experiment. Thus, one can envision

a  hybrid  system  where  low  (positive)  stretch  factors  are  obtained  by  using  dispersive

materials whereas large (negative) compression factors are obtained using compressors

with a reflection grating.

2.

Probe wavelength  tuning.

The most popular method for varying the probe wavelength in PPS experiments is

by generation of a white light supercontinuum and using narrow band interference filters

to select a wavelength range. The supercontinuum is nonlinearly chirped, with a typical

stretch factor of 20-100. Due to large beam divergence, it is difficult to compress these

pulses using a gratings compressor (although, low GVD can be obtained by dispersion in
a  fiber).  10.18    Thus,  one  is  forced  to  use  optical  parametric  amplifiers  (OPA's)  as  the

source of coherent probe light. Furthermore, the compressor must be realigned for each

probe color (due to the need to keep the incident angle reasonably close to the Littrow

angle). While this operation can be automated, it is difficult to avoid large changes in the
stretch factor since  s ∝ λ3(eq. (30)). A change-over from 800 nm to 400 nm decreases

GVD by an order of magnitude. With the exception of low GVD's, this decrease cannot
be  compensated  by  the  equivalent  increase  in  Lg.  Also,  for  λ  other than the oscillator

wavelength there is no built-in source of stretched probe pulses, and the dynamic range is

reduced.

It should be stressed that most of these problems present themselves for shorter

wavelengths;  for  longer  wavelengths,  the  change-over  is  less  problematic.  Even  for

shorter wavelengths, a ready solution exists provided that the probe beam is sufficiently

bright to tolerate losses that occur when the gratings are used in higher diffraction orders.
A typical OPA yields 2-10 µJ of the visible light, whereas less than 1 nJ is needed to

probe the sample. For a given groove spacing, the number of possible orders m (given by
< 2 ) increases as  1 λ  whereas GVD increases as m2, and the loss of GVD at the
λ dg

3S.

shorter wavelengths can be compensated by increasing m. E. g., for the standard 1200

g/mm grating compressor, 4 diffraction orders exist at 400 nm, and the Littrow angle for
the third order is still acute, ca. 46o. With this grating used in the 2nd and 3d orders, the

GVD at 400 nm is 0.5 and 2.3 times that at 800 nm in the first order. The chart shown in

Fig. 3S helps to choose the optimum Lg and m to obtain a desirable stretch factor s for a
given  wavelength  λ,  for  a  33  fs  FWHM  pulse  and  1200  g/mm  grating  (of  the  fixed

width).

3. The spectrum of the probe pulse.

While the theoretical treatment of section II is formulated for an ideal Gaussian

pulse, the spectra of probe pulses obtained using CPA (before or after the compression)

often  exhibit  low-amplitude  "ripple"  (2-10%)  juxtaposed  on  the  Gaussian  profile.  The

origin of this "ripple" can be traced to etalon and aperture effects during the passage of

the  beam  through  the  amplification  optics  and  to  the  modes  of  Ti:sapphire  oscillator

itself.  While  this  "ripple"  is  reduced  when  the  beam  passes  through  a  compressor,  it

reappears as the probe light is diffracted by the sample and the focussing optics. Due to

this diffraction, the amplitude of the "ripple" is not uniform across the beam; the central

part exhibits 2-3 times stronger oscillations than the outer part. A typical slit opening of
the  monochromator  needed  to  obtain  1-5  cm-1  resolution  is  50-100  µm  and,  in  the

absence of a diffuser, it is the central part of the beam that is imaged on the detector.

Since the reference and signal beams travel different paths and are diffracted differently,

their "ripple" patterns are not identical. While most of the "ripple" is divided out by the
normalization  of  the  signal  spectrum  by  the  reference  spectrum,  21  better  results  are

obtained when a diffuser is inserted to homogenize the light. Though the “ripple” pattern

is  still  observed,  close  semblance  between  the  "ripple"  patterns  for  the  signal  and

reference beams is achieved.

While this "ripple" is a nuisance, it has almost no effect on the FDSS kinetics. To

a first approximation, the "ripple" can be simulated as

The last approximation in eq. (B3) is justified by the fact that offsetting the coefficient β
−1   -  which  is  a  small

is  equivalent  to  a  shift  of  the  delay  time  T  of  the  pump  by  ω

osc

correction relative to the characteristic time τ

GVD of the oscillations shown in Figs. 1 to 5.

We conclude that the high-frequency "ripple" is inconsequential; at most, it adds a small
shift to the phase  φε of  ∆nω.

spread (thick solid lines) on the grating and (b) stretch factor (thick solid lines; negative
for  a  compressor)  and  third-order  dispersion  (dotted  lines) for τp=20  fs  probe  pulse
( ∆ω <267  cm-1  "optimum  range")  dispersed  using  a  1200  g/mm  grating  in  the  m-th
diffraction order at Lg=100 cm (the GVD and the beam spread are proportional to this
length). The third order dispersion (eq. (31)) is given as  −ξ ω τ

p , where ω πλ
