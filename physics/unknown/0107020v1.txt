Feedback  systems  are  essential  for  stable  operation  of  a
linear  collider,  providing  a  cost-effective  method  for
relaxing  tight  tolerances.  In  the  Stanford  Linear  Collider
(SLC),  feedback  controls  beam  parameters  such  as

adjusts  final  focus  parameters  to  maximize  luminosity
contributed to achieving record performance in the 1997-
98  run.  Performance  limitations  of  the  steering  feedback

and 

 For the Next Linear Collider (NLC), extensive feedback
systems  are  planned  as  an  integral  part  of  the  design.
Feedback  requirements  for  JLC  (the  Japanese  Linear
Collider)  are  essentially  identical  to  NLC;  some  of  the
TESLA requirements are similar but there are significant
differences.  For  NLC,  algorithms  which  incorporate
improvements  upon  the  SLC  implementation  are  being
prototyped. Specialized systems for the damping rings, RF
and  interaction  point  will  operate  at  high  bandwidth  and
fast  response.  To  correct  for  the  motion  of  individual
bunches  within  a  train,  both  feedforward  and  feedback
systems  are  planned.  SLC  experience  has  shown  that
feedback  systems  are  an  invaluable  operational  tool  for
decoupling  systems,  allowing  precision 
tuning,  and
providing  pulse-to-pulse  diagnostics.  Feedback  systems
for the NLC will incorporate the key SLC features and the
benefits of advancing technologies.

1  OPERATIONAL ISSUES

 Linear  colliders  have  severe  operational  challenges,  and
feedback systems are an essential tool. Feedback systems
distributed  throughout  the  machine  allow  less-invasive
tuning procedures,  so  that  when  upstream  parameters  are
modified,  downstream  feedback  stabilizes  the  beam,
allowing  routine  operation  to  continue.  Feedback  is  also
invaluable  in  facilitating  quick  startup  after  outages.  A
robust  design  ensures  that  the  feedback  is  not  confused
when  the  beam  returns  after  an  outage,  and  that  control
devices are not moved in the absence of beam. Feedback
is a useful element in higher-order tuning applications. In
the  SLC  linac,  the  emittance  tuning  packages  move
feedback  setpoints  to  create  an  oscillation  in  the  linac
which  is  closed  by  a  downstream  feedback.  In  the

final  focus,  the  built-in  averaging  capabilities  of  the
optimization  feedback  enable  it  to  be  used  as  a  high-
resolution  measurement  device  for  complex 
tuning
procedures.  A  variety  of  diagnostics  are  provided  for
beam  jitter,  fit  quality  and  other  information,  and  the
feedback system is also used to take a snapshot of data for
diagnosing machine trips.

2  SLC FEEDBACK

The  SLC  feedback  system  provides  a  valuable  base  of
experience  for  future  systems.  A  generalized,  database
driven beam based system [1] was implemented starting in
1990.  The  system  was  expanded  to  control  a  variety  of
beam parameters in every major region of the machine. At
the  end  of  the  1998  run,  there  were  50  control  loops  for
the SLC alone, and another 25 to support other programs
such as the PEPII B  factory,  Final  Focus  Test  Beam  and
fixed target experiments. In general the data is available to
the feedback at the pulsed rate of 120 Hz, although many
loops  run  more  slowly  due  to  CPU  limitations  and  other
considerations.

 2.1 Basic Feedback Systems

In  the  injector,  feedback  controls  a  variety  of  intensity-
related  parameters  associated  with  the  polarized  electron
gun, including laser voltages and kicker timing. A higher
order system controls the asymmetry between the intensity
of  left  and  right  polarized  beam  averaging  several
thousand pulses.

   Steering  feedback  systems  are  found  throughout  the
machine,  reading  beam  position  monitors  (BPMs)  and
moving  correctors.  Several  performance  limitations  with
these  systems  are  discussed  in  a  later  section.  A  cascade
system  was  developed 
to  minimize  overcorrection
associated  with  multiple  feedback  loops  in  a  beamline
which all control the same parameters [2].

 The  energy  of  the  SLC  is  controlled  in  a  variety  of
locations, typically by reading BPMs in a high-dispersion
region  and  moving  phase  shifters  or  controlling  klystron
amplitudes.  A  hardware  based  feedforward  system
coordinates with the beam based feedback to compensate
for  the  energy  change  due  to  intensity  fluctuations.  The
intensity  is  measured  while  the  beam  is  in  the  damping
ring and communicated to the energy feedback system in
the linac for correction on the same pulse.

   At  the  interaction  point,  a  specialized  feedback  keeps
the  beams  in  collision  using  the  beam-beam  deflection
measured  from  the  BPMs.  The  beam-beam  separation  is
determined  by  normalizing  the  deflection  to  compensate

for intensity fluctuations, and fast pulsed correctors allow
full 120 Hz control.

  2.2 Feedback Architecture and Calculations

The  SLC  feedback  system  is  generalized  and  database
driven so that feedback loops can often be added without
additional  software.  The  feedback  is  designed  to  use  the
components (CPU, BPMs, correctors, etc.) of the existing
control  system  and  dedicated  hardware  is  not  required
except  where  speed  is  essential.  A  fast  point-to-point
network  has  been  developed  to  communicate  between
different microprocessors, supporting feedback loops with
elements  from  more  than  one  region.  The  feedback
calculations use matrices which are generated offline and
stored  in  an  online  database.  The  matrix  design  is  based
on  the  state  space  formalism  of  digital  control  theory,
using  Kalman  filters  and  Linear  Quadratic  Gaussian
regulators [3]. The noise model includes a combination of
white  noise  and  low  frequency  noise,  with  the  goal  of
achieving a robust system with good step response.

  2.3 Specialized Frequency Control

The  SLC  is  a  120  Hz  pulsed  machine,  with  a  slight
difference  in  even  and  odd  pulses  (timeslots)  due  to  the
AC  power  sources,  causing  60  Hz  energy  or  trajectory
oscillations.  A  feedback  system  stabilizes  the  energy
difference  between  the  two  timeslots  using  specialized
logic 
the  average  and
difference  of  odd  and  even  pulses,  resulting  in  excellent
damping at and near the Nyquist frequency.

that  calculates  and  controls 

 A 59 Hz oscillation in the beam position was caused by
pump vibrations in the linac, and the downsampled 20 Hz
loops resulted in aliasing to 1 Hz. The rate of some linac
feedback systems was modified to minimize this aliasing.
To  damp  the  59  Hz,  feedback  with  the  timeslot  control
algorithm was implemented at the end of the linac and at
the interaction point. Performance tests showed that the 59
Hz oscillation was damped by a factor of 5.

 2.4 Optimization Feedback

Optimization feedback has been implemented for the SLC
which  uses  automated  subtolerance  excitation  techniques
in  order  to  determine  an  optimal  setting  for  a  nonlinear
system. The first optimization feedback controlled energy
spread by varying phase offsets [4]. The phase offset was
moved  up  and  down  by  a  small  amount,  averaging  over
many  pulses  and  then  the  slope  of  a  parabola  was
the  optimal  setting.  This
calculated 
application  was  found  useful  at  first  but  the  minimum
control bit size available in the hardware was too invasive
for  routine  operation,  and  this  automated  procedure  was
eventually discontinued. A similar system was  developed
to minimize the linac jitter by optimizing the damping ring
extraction  kicker  timing.  This  system  worked  well  in
principle, but was used intermittently and never remained
in routine operation.

to  determine 

 In 

the  final  focus  of 

the  SLC,  five  orthogonal
parameters for each of the two beams are routinely tuned
to  maximize  the  luminosity.  Originally,  a  scan  method
was employed, where a linear combination of devices was
moved  through  a  series  of  settings,  the  beam  size  was
measured  at  each  point,  and  a  parabola  was  fitted  to  the
square of the beam size to determine  the  optimal  setting.
The beam size was measured using beam-beam deflection
scans.  With  smaller  beam  sizes, 
the  measurement
resolution  became  a  significant  issue  [5],  leading  to  an
estimated  20-40%  luminosity  loss  due  to  mistuning.
Furthermore,  the tuning  procedures  required  a  significant
amount  of  operator  time  and  attention,  and  the  results
were  dependent  upon  individual  judgement,  resulting  in
luminosity,  monitors
variable 
became available to return a statistically significant signal
which is proportional to the luminosity on a pulse to pulse
basis.  These  monitors  use  beamstrahlung  radiation  from
the  beam-beam  interaction  and  also  wide  angle  radiated
Bhabha scattering events.

luminosity.  At  higher 

 A  fully  automated  feedback  system  [6]  was  developed
to dither each linear combination of devices through three
settings,  averaging  the  luminosity  signal  over  many
pulses. Figure 1 shows the dithering process in operation;
as the dither knob is moved, the luminosity monitors show
a  response.  Under  most  conditions,  the  Bhabha  monitor
could have excessive luminosity-related backgrounds, and
the  beamstrahlung  detector  provided  better  results.  The
offset  of  a  parabola  was  calculated  to  determine  the
optimal point. A scheduling process determined which of
the  ten  parameters  was  to  be  optimized  at  a  given  time,
based  upon  user-selected  scheduling  and  tolerances.  The
dithering  process  required  only  a  few  percent  luminosity
degradation, while improving the resolution by a factor of
5  to  10.  Overall  this  resulted  in  a  significant  net
luminosity increase, while allowing the operations staff to
concentrate on other tuning.

3  NLC FEEDBACK

The NLC requires several new types of feedback systems
in addition to the capabilities developed for the SLC. The
control  system  must  provide  the  CPU  and  network
bandwidth to support flexible feedback communications at
the full machine rate. Performance improvements are also
needed  to  remedy  problems  found  at  the  SLC.  Figure  2
shows locations where feedback systems are planned.

 3.1 Bunch-to-bunch Feedback

The  NLC  will  have  a  pulse  train  of  95  bunches.  In
addition  to  controlling  beam  parameters  for  the  mean  of
the bunches in the train, feedback systems are required to
correct  the  differences  of  intensity,  energy  and  position
along the train. Because the interbunch spacing is only 2.8
nanoseconds,  most  of  these  loops  are  not  designed  to
respond in an interbunch period, but would typically run at
the pulse rate of 120 Hz, correcting the shape of the train
on a later pulse. Specialized beam position monitors must
return information on each bunch of the train, and  pulsed
actuators are required to have enough bandwidth to adjust
the individual bunches.

 An  ultrafast  feedback  is  being  studied  to  bring  the
beams  into  collision  for  subsequent  bunches  of  the  pulse
train  [7].  Separate  dedicated  hardware  based  systems
would  control  the  horizontal  and  vertical  planes.  The
relative  beam  offset  would  be  measured  by  an  outgoing
beam position monitor near the interaction  point,  and  the
control  actuator  would  be  a  weak,  fast  kicker  controlling
the 
the  other  beam.  This
configuration  minimizes  delays  for  signal  travel  as  both
measurement and control are in the same location. A pilot
bunch  which  is  sent  through  undeflected,  without  the
opposing  beam,  would  provide  a  reference  for  deflection
calculations. The measured deflection of the first colliding
bunches can then be used to calculate a correction for the
remainder  of  the  train.  The  gain  factor  to  convert

incoming  position  of 

deflection  angle  to  position  would  be  set  by  an  interface
with  a  slower  software  based  feedback.  Preliminary
estimates  indicate  that  the  feedback  may  be  able  to
produce a control response within about 10 ns.

 3.2 Damping Rings

For  the  NLC  damping  rings,  longitudinal  and  transverse
feedback systems will take  advantage  of  architecture  and
algorithms  from  storage  rings  such  as  PEPII,  APS,  PSI,
etc.  Some  of  these  will  be  dedicated  high-bandwidth
systems,  but  beam  based  global  or  local  orbit  feedback
systems are also anticipated.

 3.3 Additional Capabilities

Several  other  unusual  feedback  systems  are  planned  for
the  NLC.  To  stabilize  vibration  of  the  final  quadrupoles
near the IP, a hybrid system may be used to span both low
and  high  frequencies.  An  accelerometer  based  system
measuring  vibration  data  at  5  KHz  may  provide  high
frequency response while a beam based feedback running
at  120  Hz  covers  low  frequencies.  Another  feedback
system must synchronize the phases of the two final focus
crab cavities. Additional systems will stabilize the relative
phase of the beam with respect to the RF, and control the
effective  fiber  length  for  the  timing  system.  Finally,  a
variety of RF-related feedback systems are planned.

 3.4 Control System Issues

The NLC feedback system will be well integrated with the
the  control  system.  Feedback  will  share
rest  of 
measurements with users, so that requested measurements
do not interrupt the feedback system. Sufficient CPU and
networking  are  planned,  so  that  feedback  can  generally
run  at  the  full  beam  rate  and  latency  is  minimized.  The
standard  timing  budget  will  result  in  a  control  response
within two 120 Hz interpulse periods after a perturbation
is seen. One pulse is allowed for digitization of the BPMs,
network  traffic  and  feedback  computations.  A  second

pulse  is  required  to  ramp  power  supplies  and  affect  the
beam. New  BPMs are designed for high resolution, good
stability and wide dynamic range.

 Coordination  with  the  main  control  system  is  essential
to  maximize  effectiveness.    Diagnostics  should  include
fast time plots, where users can view beam parameters on
a pulse to pulse basis, as well as longer-term history plots,
RMS  calculations  and  FFTs.  Feedback  data  should  be
accessible  to  and  integrated  with  other  applications.
Applications  should  be  able  to  automatically  turn  on  and
off  feedback  loops,  change  setpoints  and  obtain  control
values.  A  variety  of  measurement  devices  and  actuator
types  should  be  supported  in  order  to  allow  for  easy
expansion.  Other  applications  must  recognise  when  a
device  is  under  feedback  control  to  avoid  contention.
Finally,  flexible  networking  systems  must  accommodate
unplanned future extensions.

  4  PERFORMANCE ISSUES

Performance  limitations  have  been  a  significant  area  of
concern  with  the  SLC  feedback  system,  and  one  of  the
goals  for  the  NLC  is  to  insure  that  these  issues  are
adequately  understood  and  addressed.  Experiments  using
the  SLC  have  been  able  to  identify  and  characterize  a
variety of problems.

 4.1 Cascade

In  both  the  SLC  and  NLC,  the  linac  is  a  long,  straight
beamline with several orbit feedback systems in sequence.
Overcompensation  and  ringing  will  occur  if  multiple
systems  respond  to  the  same  disturbance.  For  the  SLC
linac,  a  cascade  system  communicates  processed  beam
information  from  each  feedback  to  the  next  downstream
loop. The transport matrices between loops are calculated
adaptively  to  eliminate  sensitivity  to  optics  drifts.  The
system  was  initially  successful,  allowing  feedback  to  run
at high gain factors with good system response. However,
this  algorithm  assumes 
is
the  beam 
that 
independent of the source of a perturbation.

transport 

 With  higher 

intensity  operation,  wakefields  and
chromatic  effects  make  the  beam  transport  nonlinear  and
oscillations propagate differently depending on their point
of  origin.  When  a  bunch  passes  off-axis  through  the
accelerating  structures,  the  asymmetric  fields  induced  by
the head of the bunch kick the later particles, producing a
tilted  distribution  which  remains  after  the  centroid  is
corrected. In order to correctly model the beam transport,
each  feedback  must  receive  information  from  all  of  the
upstream  loops  to  identify  the  source  of  the  disturbance
and  avoid  overcorrection.  An  improved  algorithm  has
been successfully tested in simulation.

 4.2 Simulation Environment

In  order  to  evaluate  feedback  designs  and  analyze
performance issues, a Matlab simulation environment was
created [8]. The LIAR beam transport code [9] is called as

a  subroutine,  realistically  simulating  wakefields,  ground
motion  effects  such  as  ATL,  and  other  errors  including
alignment  and  field  strength.  The  state  space  matrix
design program was converted from MatrixX to Matlab to
allow  for  easier  simulations  and  evaluation  of  alternative
algorithms.

 4.3 Configuration for Wakefield Effects

The  configuration  of  feedback  for  the  NLC  linac  was
modelled  using  the  Matlab  simulation  environment.  The
original proposal was based on a typical SLC setup, where
linac feedback  loops use a minimal number  of  correctors
immediately  followed  by  8-10  BPMs.  Due  to  wakefield
effects,  this  configuration  resulted  in  a  large  orbit  RMS
and  significant  emittance  growth.  Figure  3  shows  the
vertical beam position along the linac after a perturbation
has been introduced at the beginning of the linac and the
feedback has converged. Each feedback perfectly flattens
the orbit at the feedback BPMs, but large orbit excursions
are seen between the feedback locations.

Fig 4: Linac Orbit with Improved Feedback Configuration

   Several alternative configurations were evaluated with
respect  to  orbit  RMS,  emittance  growth,  bunch  shape  at
the  end  of  the  linac,  and  ATL  ground  motion  response.
Better  performance  was  achieved  by  adding  more  beam
position  monitors  and  correctors  than  were  originally
proposed.  When  these  additional  devices  are  spread  over
long  distances  in  a  single  feedback,  the  wakefield
compensation  can  be  further  improved.  However,  there
are  practical  limitations  to  the  span  of  a  single  feedback
due to imperfections in the model. For a global feedback
controlling the entire linac, these errors can be significant
and  degrade  performance.  More  work  is  needed  to
evaluate  beam  transport  variation  with  klystron  phase
offsets  and  other  errors.  In  the  presently  preferred
configuration,  the  linac  is  divided  among  five  feedback
systems, each including four sets of BPMs and two sets of
correctors.  Figure  4  shows  the  resulting  beam  trajectory
for  this  system,  after  it  has  responded  to  the  same
disturbance shown in figure 3.

 4.4 Other Performance Issues

Measurements of SLC corrector response determined that
the speeds of many devices were much slower than in the
feedback  design  model.  The  model  assumes  a  delay  of
two  120  Hz  pulses  for  the  actuators  to  respond  but  in
many locations,  the measured  response  is  a  ramp  of  9  or
more pulses. Simulations indicate this would have only a
moderate  effect  on  feedback  performance  if  it  were  the
only 
flaw.  However,  when  combined  with  other
imperfections,  the  slow  correctors  can  have  a  significant
performance impact.

 In some areas of the SLC, the beam transport is poorly
modeled. Sometimes this can be fixed by identifying and
correcting accelerator errors such as klystron mis-phasing.
Otherwise a  calibration  procedure  is  used  to  measure  the
beam transport and incorporate it into the feedback design.
 Hardware  problems  such  as  broken  correctors  and
erratic  BPMs  also  degrade  the  feedback  performance  if
they are not detected. Due to limited CPU and networking
and  a  suboptimal  cascade  scheme,  many  feedback  loops
run  slower  than  the  full  120  Hz  pulse  rate,  and  most  run
with  decreased  feedback  gain  factors.  This  results  in  a
system response which amplifies beam noise around 1 Hz.
At the SLC, the large number of feedback loops, the many
sources  of  imperfections,  and  inadequate  diagnostic  tools
result in degraded feedback performance.

 For NLC, plans are underway to ensure that these issues
are  adequately  addressed.  Additional  SLC  beam  testing
and  simulations  are  planned.  More  work  is  needed  to
analyze  calibration  or  adaption  schemes  for  the  beam
transport model. In order to diagnose remaining problems
a feedback performance watchdog is needed. An excellent
algorithm  for  this  could  come  from  model-independent
analysis techniques [10], which are capable of identifying
the locations of broken BPMs, correctors and misbehaving
feedback loops.

  5  TESLA FEEDBACK

The  TESLA  Linear  Collider  has  some  significant
differences from NLC. The linac uses superconducting RF
where  the  wakefield  effects  are  minimal,  simplifying  the
feedback requirements. The interbunch spacing is 377 ns,
compared  with  2.8  ns  in  the  NLC.  This  allows  for  orbit
feedback  systems  to  more  easily  correct  on  subsequent
bunches of the train. Plans for these systems are described
more fully in reference [11].

 6  CONCLUSIONS

Linear colliders present significant challenges for controls,
due  to  tight  tolerances  and  stability  requirements,  and
complex  tuning  procedures.  Extensive  feedback  systems
are an essential tool for operation. Much work remains to
be  done  for  future  colliders  to  insure  that  the  benefits  of
these 
realized,  while
addressing  the performance issues associated with a large
number of  systems.
