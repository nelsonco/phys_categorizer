Abstract.  The  diversity  of  the  symbols  of  the  information  source  is  calculated  following  the

definition  that  entropy  is  the  information  loss  and  following  a  new  entropy-symbol  similarity

relation after the rejection of the Gibbs paradox statement. Diversity in a range of 0 to 1, an index

similar to Shannon's redundancy, decreases with the increase in the species similarities. A pairwise

similarity formula has been defined and used to demonstrated that the diversity expression gives the

expected  diversity.  The  higher  entropy-higher  similarity  relation  leads  to  the  higher  information-

higher diversity relation.

1. Introduction

Keywords: Species diversity, entropy, information loss, similarity, diversity calculation.

Biodiversity  assessment  has  been  a  hot  topic  of  practical  importance  for  preservation  of  existing

biological species in a rational way. With the development of high throughput screening technology

(a very fast way of testing if a molecule is active as a drug) in the pharmaceutical industry in recent

years, the acquisition of molecular samples by collection and combinatorial or parallel, automatic

synthesis  has  now  become  the  bottleneck  in  the  process  of  new  drug  discovery.  The  molecular

diversity assessment also became an urgent topic [1,2].

There are many methods of calculating diversity of species (either biological or chemical species).

Natually  the  best  approach  should  be  the  information  theoretical  method,  using  information

theoretical concepts [3]. We tried to set up a new method of diversity calculation [1]. It is based on

a  clear  definition  that  entropy  is  the  information  loss  [4]  and  a  new  relation  of  entropy-similarity

(Figure  1c)  [5-7]  constructed  after  rejection  of  the  Gibbs  paradox  statement  (Figure  1a)  [8].  In

information theory discussed in communication, all the symbols used for encoding are assumed to

be  distinguishable.  However,  we  discuss  the  species  diversity  of  these  symbols  (individual

molecules  in  molecular  diversity  and  animals  in  biodiversity  considerations).  Therefore,  it  is  the

similarity of these symbols and their relation to entropy that are of particular interest to us, and we

must  adapt  the  formulas  used  by  Shannon  to  the  situation  concerned  here.  Furthermore,  the

consideration of the diversity and the similarity of these "symbols" (molecules or other individules)

at  the  "information  source"  (the  considered  system)  are  very  significant  in  the  studies  of  the

structural stabilities in physics, chemistry and biology.

In  this  paper,  simple  examples  and  a  pairwise  similarity  formula  suitable  for  assessing  molecular

diversity has been presented and used for species diversity calculation.

2. Entropy-information loss and entropy-similarity

The choice of the definition that entropy is information loss [4] is convenient because it is at least

already widely accepted by biologists and chemists. Entropy is defined here as a concept equivalent

to Shannon's uncertainty.

Another reason of using "entropy is information loss" definition is that there are only two kinds of

information losses: one is due to dynamic motion which is illustrated in Figure 2; the other is due to

intrinsic  similarity  of  the  symbols  or  the  physical  or  conceptual  entities  (biological  or  chemical

species,  or  1  and  0  used  for  a  binary  system).  Both  information  losses  can  happen  actually  in

examples of communication (see the following).

Shannon  defined  entropy  (H)  as  a  measures  of  information,  choice  and  uncertainty.  Entropy,

denoted here as S, is given by the familiar expression (the positive coefficient is taken as 1):

where  p i  is the probability of the ith microstate with the property that

Hrere we use a microstate as a symbol defined in Shannon's information source (Sometimes we will

also use microstate as a message, which is made out of symbols. A microstate can be regarded as a

composite  symbols.  An  example  of  the  composite  symbol  is  the  edcoding  of  A,  B,  C,  D,  etc  by

binary symbols 0 and 1. An "A" can be represented by a long composite symbol, a longer sequence

of 0 and 1). Information loss due to dynamic motion is simple. If a set of all possible symbols all

appears  simultaneously  with  the  identical  probabilities,  the  situation  is  most  chaotic  (figure  2).

Consequently  there  is  no  actual  message  selected.  This  is  due  to  the  similarity  of  the  probability

values of all the possible messages. If these probability values are the most similar (or the same),

we have the highest entropy (

w=

) following the well-known inequality

w

i=1

(

p
i

ln

i )
p

ln

w

Then, the information has the minimum value (zero, I=0, see the following section).

Even though it has not been discussed in Shannon's classical paper [3], the information loss due to

the intrinsic similarity of symbols (and consider if these symbols belong to a set of distinguishable

species  by  comparison,  or  consider  directly  the  similarity  of  the  species  themselves)  at  the

information source seems also clear. If all the fonts used in "I love her" are extremely similar (or

the same) and this font is represented by @, we will have a sentence reads "@ @@@@ @@@"

(Figure  3).  If  a  typewriter  has  all  keys  actually  extremely  similar,  to  say  all  actually  like  "@".  A

discrete source using these extremely similar w microstates (symbols) actually cannot generate any

information. If you send a telegraph by using this set of 26 symbols instead of the distinguishable

26-symbol "alphabet" (the 26 letters), of course the information loss will be obvious. Actually these

26 symbols are all @. Applying quations 1 and 2 will give the maximum entropy (Expression 3).

Therefore,  both  cases  satisfy  the  general  relation  of  higher  similarity-higher  entropy  (or  higher

information loss) (Figure 1c).

Incidentally  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  higher  entropy-higher  similarity  relation  Figure  1c)

holds universally true, where the mathematical proof is simply rooted at the well-known inequality

(3)  where  the  right  side  is  the  maximum  entropy  because  all  the  w  microstates  or  symbols  are

extremely  similar  or  the  same.  This  is  summarized  as  the  similarity  principle:  If  all  the  other

conditions remain constant, the higher the similarity among the components is, the higher value of

entropy of the mixing (for fluid phases), the assembling (for solid phases) or any other analogous

processes  (of  assemblage  formation,  such  as  quantum  states  in  quantum  mechanics)  will  be,  the

more spontaneous the processes will be, and the more stable the mixture and the assemblage will

be.  Practically  this  conforms  to  and  explained  all  the  related  experimental  facts,  e.g.,  phase

separation.  Different  substances  do  not  mix  but  spontaneously  separate  because 

the

indistinguishable  substances  are  the  most  spontaneously  miscible  ones.  In  other  words,  as  a

consequence of the most spontaneously mixing of the most similar (indistinguishable) substances,

different  substances  separate.  Theoretically  this  is  also  conforms  to,  and  can  be  used  to  prove

Curie's  symmetry  principle  (the  effects  are  more  symmetric  than  the  causes)  following  a  "higher

similarity-higher  symmetry-higher  entropy-higher  stability"  relation.  After  the  proof  of  the

symmetry  principle,  and  after  the  the  connection  of  the  symmetry  principle  and  the  second  law

being  established,  many  outstanding  phase  transition  problems  (symmetry  breaking  probems)  can

be elegantly solved also [5,6].

It should be emphasized that a clear definition that entropy is information loss should be both very

convenient  and  very  necessary  for  further  development  in  information  theory  towards  its

application in structural stability and process spontaneity characterization in physics, chemistry and

biology.

3. The formula

We  define  diversity  on  a  relative  scale  [1].  The  diversity  index  (D)  defined  here  is  equivalent  to

Shannon's  definition  of  redundancy.  It  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  information  (I)  and  the

maximum information ( Im

),

Entropy is unambiguously defined as information loss by the following relation:

In this equation, entropy is given by the familiar expression (euqtion 1), where  p i  is the probability

of the ith microstate with the property that

while the maximum entropy is  S

w

, where w is the indistinguishability number which is the

n=

number  of  microstates  (or  symbols)  of  indistinguishable  property  [1].  Because  both  information

and  entropy  are  logarethmic  functions,  both  are  never  negative.  Their  minimum  values  are  both

zero. Their maximum values are the same value also ( m

ISw ==

).

The apparent indistinguishability number of microstates (or symbols) is defined as

and equation 1 becomes

=

w

w

p

p

S

w= l

   

which  is  the  logarithmic  relation  of  entropy  and  indistinguishability.  Now  the  number  of  the

indistinguishable symbols is 

aw .

Practically, in order to record information at the information source, a system composed of N “unit

devices”  is  used.  In  computer  science  or  in  our  daily  information  recording  as  well,  these  “unit

devices” are N symbols assembled on a media such as a piece of paper. These symbols appear as M

attributes, based upon which it is said that the system has M species, such as the two species 0 and 1

in the binary system [3].

Because  the  assessment  of  diversity  of  N  symbols  (molecules  or  chemical  samples  for  molecular

diversity and a plant or an animal for biodiversity) is our only concern [4], the number of symbols

(N)  and  the  maximum  species  number  (M)  are  designated  as  the  same:  N M=

.  This  can  be

envisaged as N holes in microplates used for bioactivity screening containing N compound samples.

Normally  N  can  be  either  greater  or  smaller  than  M.  For  example,  a  harddisk  of  N  bits  has  N

symbols with M equals 2. Normally if one puts 200 Chinese characters in a typical page of paper

written  in  Chinese  where  N  equals  200  and  (here  the  species  number  M  is  the  total  number  of

different Chinese characters normally used which is 10000).

If these N symbols are all distinguishable, they can be used to record the maximum information as

given by equation 8.

For instance, if red ink is used to represent 0 and blue ink 1, and two bottles of these different inks

are used, 2 bits of information can be recorded if the number of symbol (N) is 2. There will be 4

(w =

=

)  distinguishable  microstates,  see  Figure  4).  It  is  said  that  this  is  the  maximum

information  (equation  8)  because  one  can  still  intentionally  use  only  a  small  part  of  the  available

species  to  record  only  smaller  amount  of  information.  In  equation  8,  w  is  the  number  of

distinguishable microstates:

w N N

From equation 5, the corresponding entropy has the minimum value which is zero:

This extreme case is illustrated in Figure 4 (N=2, w=4) and Figure 5 (N=3, w=27) [8].

Let all the N samples in the N bottles are the samples of extremely similar (or the same) property.

Then there will be still  w N N

microstates (or  N N   assemblages)  constructed  by  the  N N   times  of

=

different  combinatorial  sequences  of  assembling  to  form  solid  structures.  However,  because  they

are  all  virtually  indistinguishable  microstates,  there  is  always  the  minimum  information  and  the

maximum entropy (eqs 11 and 12):

For  example,  suppose  you  have  accidentally  installed  two  bottles  of  red  ink  for  a  printer.  Even

though  exactly  the  same  amount  of  effort  is  taken  to  prepare  the  4  microstates,  i.e.,  the  four

microstates are prepared in a same way as that of Figure 4 by using inks from the two individual

bottles, there will be 4 (w =

) indistinguishable microstates (see Figure 6). Similarly, whether

we factually take the same sample from one sample bottle or different sample bottles in bioactivity

test  laboratory,  we  always  have  w  indistinguishable  microstates,  if  they  are  virtually  the  same

compound in all the N bottles; see Figure 6 (N=2, w=4, if all species are factually 0) and Figure 7

(N=3, w=27, if all species are B). The maximum microstate indistinguishability number is therefore

These  two  extreme  sets  of  distinguishable  and  indistinguishable  microstates,  which  give  the

minimum  (zero)  entropy  and  the  maximum  entropy  values,  respectively  (equations  10  and  12),

already  illustrated  our  unique  approach  based  on  our  similarity-entropy  relation  (see  also  Figure

Generally,  suppose  the  N  symbols  used  to  construct  N N microstates  are  only  mutually  similar  to

certain  extent  among  them  and  they  are  neither  distinguishable  (equations  8  and  10)  nor

indistinguishable  (equations  11  and  12).  Instead  of  using  equation  1  directly,  eq  14  is  used  to

Then  equation  14  will  give  the  same  results  as  given  by  eqs  10  and  12  directly  and  respectively

In principle, the general equation (equation 4) should be directly used, where w is simply replaced

by  N N .  The  obvious  disadvantage  of  using  equation  4  directly  is  that  the  sum  runs  all  over  the

N N microstates (see Figures 4-7). The calculation of these terms of enormous number  N N , which

Secondly, we may not be really interested in using the chemical samples or individual molecule to

record information by taking the sample bottles as "unit devices". Therefore, we will not perform

experiment  or  calculation  to  characterize  the  chemical  structural  and  other  physicochemical

properties  of  all  these  N N   microstates  (combinatorial  assemblings).  Instead,  we  measure  (or

calculate  from  the  known  structures)  the  properties  of  the  N  individuals,  based  on  which  the

pairwise similarities between any two compounds are to be relatively much easily calculated. This

means  that,  instead  of  considering  similarities  and  probabilities  among  N N microstates,  only  N 2

probabilities  pA

,  pA

,  pA

, etc., calculated from the pairwise similarities among the N individuals

A, B, C, ..., etc., will be considered.

The first column of Table 1 showed several sets of three imaginary compound samples or symbols

(A,  B  and  C)  on  a  uniform  property  scale  as  used  by  Agrafiotis  [10].  If  the  properties  of  the

samples are the same, the points will coincide and these three samples all will be regarded as the

same  samples.  If  their  distances  are  very  short  and  they  are  very  close,  they  are  regarded  as  very

similar.

The probability  pij  calculated from equation 17 means the probability of finding the jth symbol as

the ith species, or the jth sample as the ith chemical species.

The diversity of these symbols is yet to be assessed and unknown; they are presumably similar to

each other to certain extent among them [1]. Therefore, the comparisons are not performed between

the N individuals and a set of a priori known set of distinguishable prototypes; the comparisons are

performed  among  the  N  individuals  themselves  directly.  The  normalization  factor  c  is  required

because these values are subject to the constraint:

Using  this  method  properly,  the  molecular  diversity  as  expressed  by  the  diversity  index  D  and

several  related  parameters  can  be  calculated.  For  instance,  to  compare  the  diversity  of  several

selections  of  a  sublibrary  of  compounds  (molecules)  from  all  available  chemical  sources,  and  to

acquire the same number of samples of the highest diversity for many different screening purposes,

the sublibrary of minimized entropy S and the maximized information I is desirable.

4. Pairwise Similarity Definition and Calculation

Before  calculating  the  biodiversity  or  molecular  diversity  of  N  individuals  (symbols),  the

similarities for all the mutual pairwise comparisons among all the N individuals should be clearly

defined. Whether it is a proper definition of pairwise similarities can be quickly checked first by the

following criteria of the two extreme cases: (a) If N symbols are all distinguishable, the entropy of

this system is the minimum which is zero (equation 10). (b) If  N species are all indistinguishable,

the entropy of this system is the maximum (equation 12).

If the pairwise similarities are estimated directly by either

or

which might be suitable for other methods [10], the maximum number of distinguishable species is

only 2, located at the two ends of the property scale, 0.00 and 1.00, respectively. The distance  dij

between  these  two  least  similar  species  is  1.00.  This  does  not  conform  with  the  first  simple

criterion (equation 10).

Note,  equation  (23)  does  not  conform  with  the  second  criterion  either:  The  minimum  similarity

value is 0.5, instead of zero, which is normally the minimum value of a properly defined similarity

scale  [11].  The  minimum  value  corresponds  to  the  largest  distance,  which  is  1  in  Agrafiotis'

definition [10].

We propose that, instead of equation 22, the following formula of pairwise similarity, which clearly

conforms with the two simple criteria, is adopted:

In this formula, the shortest distance, which defines that certain two species are distinguishable, is

provided  that  the  property  scale  range  is  [0,  1].  Again,  remember  that  "distinguishability"  means

the  least  similarity.  If  the  distance  is  shorter  than  1

According to equation 24, it is easily verified that the individuals most uniformly distributed on the

property scale have the highest diversity (the first row in Table 1,  M N

a =

,  s

a = 1

 and  S = 0 ),

where all species are distinguishable, in contrast to a collection of samples as shown in the last row

in Table 1, which has the lowest diversity and the highest indistinguishability ( Ma = 1 ,  s

a =

=N 3

and  S = 3

).  For  the  latter  case  (the  last  row  in  Table  1),  because  the  locations  on  the  property

scale of these three individuals are the same, they are the same species and all can be represented by

one same symbol, to say B; the 27 indistinguishable microstates are those listed in Figure 5.

The  calculation  results  of  several  representative  sets  of  samples  by  using  eq  24  for  pairwise

similarity calculation are listed in Table 1.

5. Concluding Remarks

Traditionally the statistical mechanics concepts (e.g, Shannon's entropy [3] and the parameter of E.

T.  Jaynes  [12]  which  is  similar  to  temperature)  and  statistical  mechanics  expressions  were

introduced  to  information  theory.  This  paper  has  described  an  application  of  information  theory

concepts in diversity assessment by introducing a new relation of entropy-similarity, based on the

rejection of Gibes paradox statement, after the new relation of entropy-similarity having been used

in  many  areas  of  physics  and  chemistry  for  structural  stability  and  process  spontaneity

characterization [5-7]. We can see clearly that the similarity (Z) of the species in a system (fauna and

flora in an ecosystem or a mixture of molecules in a chemical reaction container) [1]

increases with the decrease in diversity (D). The diversity defined here, even though only a relative

scale,  is  useful  for  comparison,  for  monitoring  the  trend  of  the  evolution  and  for  the  decision

making. Similarity (Z), called relative entropy by Shannon, is defined as

1ZD=-

=

 

Z

S

S

which depends directly on the pair-wise similarities.

In  contrast  to  the  using  of  statistical  mechanics  concepts  to  information  theory,  which  seems

successful  so  far,  the  application  of  information  theory  to  statistical  mechanics  has  been

unsuccessful. For instance, Jaynes' theory [12] has only been used to pure data reduction. In order

to  do  this,  it  is  necessary  to  define  clearly  the  basic  concepts.  We  have  demonstrated  that  it  is

possible to avoid the widespread and continuous conceptual confusion between the information loss

of dynamic mixing and the information loss in static assembling and to recognize that both satisfy

the definition of entropy is information loss (Equation 5).

The  application  of  statistical  mechanics  already  has  some  foundamental  problems.  An  obvious

problem is the Gibbs paradox, which is closely related to information theory [8]. The new relation

(higher  entropy-higher  similarity  relation,  Figure  1c)  contrasting  to  the  so  far  widely  accepted

relations  (Figure  1a  or  1b),  must  have  theoretical  consequences  in  many  areas.  Therefore,  the

establishment of this new entropy-similarity relation, which is true in both dynamic and static cases,

13

will be a significant step towards the direct application of some methods of information theory in

statistical  mechanics  and  thermodynamics.  In  a  following  paper,  we  will  use  this  entropy-

information  loss  definition  and  the  new,  higher  entropy-higher  similarity  relation  to  discuss  the

symmetry problem [13,14]. A system of very high symmetry must have high entropy value and less

information  than  a  less  symmetric  system.  A  system  of  high  diversity,  which  has  been  discussed

here, must appear less symmetric.

letters used for information registration are actually look the same (have same properties as D), we

have information loss due to the reduced number of species used for information recording or due

to the reduction of diversity [1]. Any system of high diversity must have low similarity [1].
