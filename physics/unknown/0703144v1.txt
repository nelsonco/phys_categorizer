   Abstract:  Present  human  languages  display  slightly  asymmetric  log-normal  (Gauss) 
distribution for size [1-3], whereas present cities follow power law (Pareto-Zipf law)[4]. Our 
model  considers  the  competition  between  languages  and  that  between  cities  in  terms  of 
growing  (multiplicative  noise  process)[5]  and  fragmentation  [6];  where,  relevant  parameters 
are (naturally) different for languages and cities. We consider lifetime distribution for old and 
living  languages  and  that  for  old  and  living  cities.  We  study  also  the  effect  of  random 
elimination  (punctuation)  within  time  evolution  of  languages  and  cities.  Finally,  we  assume 
decreasing  exponential  distribution  for  cities  over  size  with  independent  random  amplitude 
and random (negative) exponent; and show that, this gives the Pareto-Zipf law. 
 
1   Introduction: Our essential aim is to show that similar processes may be governing time 
evolution of competition between languages or cities, yet with different parameters, where the 
most crucial ones are two: Rate for the growth within a multiplicative noise process [5] and a 
factor for fragmentation [6]. It is similar to real life; origination (birth), spread and extinction 
takes place in terms of fragmentation and growth is due to multiplicative noise process. 
   Empirical criteria for our results are: i) Number of living languages and that of living cities 
(towns, villages, etc.) may be different; but, total size for the present time must be the same 
for both cases, where the mentioned size is world population. ii) World population increases 
exponentially  (super  exponentially,  for  recent  times)  with  time.[3,  7]  iii)  At  present,  the 
biggest  language  (Mandarin  Chinese)  is  spoken  by  about  1.025  billion  people  and  world 
population (as, the prediction made by United Nations) is 6.5 billion in 2005, (and to be about 
10 billion in 2050) [7]; so the ratio of the size for the biggest language to (the total size, i.e.,) 
world  population  must  be  (about)  1:6.5.  iv)  Size  distribution  for  the  present  time  must  be 
slightly  asymmetric  log-normal  for  languages  [1],  and  this  must  be  power  law  -1  for  the 
present cities (Pareto-Zipf law)[4]. It is known that, many (old) languages and (old) cities are 
not living at present. So, we consider random elimination in both cases (punctuation); which 
might  have  occurred  due  to  some  historical  reasons,  such  as  mass  immigration,  being 
colonized, lose of war, and wide spread illness, etc. Secondly, we aim at showing that Pareto-
Zipf law may be emerging from decreasing exponential distribution of number of cities over 
size, where independent random numbers are used; one for amplitude and one for (negative) 
exponent.  Following  section  is  the  model,  and  next  one  is  applications  and  results.  Last 
section is devoted for discussion and conclusion. We will display some more properties of the 
mentioned exponential functions within Appendix. 
 
2      Model:  For  languages  or  cities  (i),  we  have  various  number  of  ancestors  (M(0)),  all  of 
which have random initial size Pi(0). They grow in time (t), with a random rate (Ri≤R, where 
R is universal) within a random multiplicative noise process, 
 

Pi(t) = (1 + Ri)Pi(t − 1)  ,

and if a random number is smaller than the splitting probability H, then the language or city 
(i) splits, with the splitting ratio (fragmentation, mutation factor) S, which has the following 
meaning: If the current number of speakers of a language or population of a city (i) is Pi(t), 
SPi(t)  many  members  form  another  population  and  (1−S)Pi(t)  many  survive  during  the

fragmentation at t. Number of languages or cities (M(t)) increases by one if one language or 
city (i) splits; if any two of them split at t, then M(t) increases by two, etc. Furthermore, we 
assume that, if for H<<1 this random number is larger than some G near 1, the language or the 
city becomes extinct. It is obvious that, results do not change if 1 − S is substituted for S, i.e., 
if  the  mutated  and  surviving  members  are  interchanged.  So,  the  greatest  value  for  S  is  0.5, 
effectively.  Please  note  that,  fragmentation  causes  new  agents  to  emerge  (birth),  and  at  the 
same time it drives them to extinction in terms of splitting, and any language or city with a 
member less than unity is considered as extinct. 
   Time evolution of (total number of human speaking all of the current languages or living in 
all of the current cities, i.e.,) world population is 
 

W(t) = ∑ M(t)

i=1Pi(t)  ,   

 

 

(2) 

where a city may actually also be a village of single house, except if we demand a minimum 
population. 
   It is obvious that, if one changes M(0) to M'(0) without changing origin and unit for time 
scale, then M(t) must be changed to M'(t), where M'(t)= M(t)(M'(0)/M(0)). Secondly, if time 
steps of the evolution are long enough (and the total number of time steps is small), we may 
have more fragmentation per unit time. If on the other hand, time steps are considerably short 
(for big number of total time steps), intermittency may become crucial. Moreover, there may 
be various other reasons for waiting periods of time in fragmentation, as well as in population 
growth. We assumed an intermittency factor (H) for splitting, which is taken same for all of 
languages  or  of  cities.  Please  note  that,  H  =1=G  gives  gradual  evolution,  where  we  have  a 
regular fragmentation with H (and, with some S) at each time step t. This case is kept out of 
the present scope, because we consider it as (historically) unrealistic. Thirdly, we know that 
not  all  of  the  ancestor  and  old  languages  or  cities  survive,  and  we  have  many  ancient  (and 
older) languages which are not spoken any more and many of the old cities are archeological 
sites now. The relevant number of people might have immigrated and changed the language 
and city, they might have changed their language after being colonized within the same cities 
and they might have became totally extinct after a lost war, or after a wide spread and severe 
illness, etc. We count such cases as random eliminations by the rate G, at each t. We keep the 
(historical)  reasons  out  of  the  present  scope,  and  consider  only  the  results;  and  once  the 
reasons are kept away, the results of them may naturally be taken as random. In summary; if a 
random number (which is defined for each t) is smaller than H, for H<1, then the language or 
city splits (by S); and, if the random number is larger than some G near 1, then the language 
or city becomes extinct; and, in between it grows (for each time step by R, at most). Number 
of  languages  or  cities  increases,  decreases,  or  fluctuates  about  M(0)  for  (relatively)  big 
numbers for H (high fragmentation) and G (low elimination), for small numbers for H (low 
fragmentation)  and  G  (high  elimination),  and  for  H+G=1  (equal  fragmentation  and 
elimination),  respectively;  out  of  which  we  regard  only  the  first  case,  where  we  have  (for 
1<H+G) increase in the number of agents and we disregard the others. Because, it is known 
(guessed) that the number of cities (languages) did not decrease ever in past. We try several 
number  of  ancestors  M(0),  with  sizes  Pi(0),  for  the  selected  case,  where  we  assign  new 
random growth rates for new languages or cities, which are not changed later, as well as the 
growth rates for ancestors are kept as same through the time evolution. 
   For  lifetime,  we  simply  subtract  the  number  of  time  step  at  which  a  language  or  city  is 
generated,  from  that  one  at  which  the  given  agent  became  extinct,  where  the  agent  may 
become extinct since its size becomes less then unity in terms of fragmentation or since it is 
randomly eliminated. In any case, we have two different definitions for lifetime; one is for the 
extinct agents and the other is for living agents (age). We may define μ(τ,t) as the probability 
(density) function, where t stands for the number of time steps, and τ stands for ages, and μ 

 

- 2 -

counts the languages or cities with age τ at t (with 0<τ ≤t). It is obvious that, the integral of μ 
overτ (with 0<τ ≤t) gives the number of living (not all, but) generated languages or cities at t, 
which  is  equal  to  the  number  of  total  living  agents  (M(t))  minus  the  number  of  living 
ancestors, which goes zero with t(cid:198)∞. 
   Please note that, the introduced parameters have units involving time, and our time unit is 
arbitrary. After some period of evolution in time we (reaching the present) stop the simulation 
and  calculate  probability  distribution  function  (PDF)  for  size,  and  for  some  other  functions 
such as extinction frequency, lifetime, etc., (for languages or cities).  Number of interaction 
tours  may  be  chosen  as  arbitrary  (without  following  historical  time,  since  we  do  not  have 
historical  data),  with  different  time  units;  and,  the  parameters  (with  units)  may  be  refined 
accordingly. Yet, in most cases relative values (with respect to other cases; population growth 
rate  in  different  runs,  for  example)  and  ratios  of  the  parameters  (the  ratio  of  S  to  H,  for 
example) are important. 
 
3   Applications and results: Languages and cities are man made systems; and, language is 
not  a  physical  quantity,  whereas  city  is  a  physical  quantity.  Yet,  we  find  many  similarities 
between  them.  We  first  consider  languages  (sect.  3.1),  later  we  study  cities  (sect.  3.2),  in 
section  3.3  we  compare  the  results  for  languages  and  cities;  and  finally,  in  section  3.4,  we 
utilize exponential (decreasing) functions with two independent random numbers; one for the 
amplitude  and  one  for  the  (negative)  exponent,  where  our  essential  aim  is  to  show  that  the 
mentioned sum gives Pareto-Zipf power law for size distribution.

0, for initial parameters M(0) and P (0). 

3.1   Languages: In our initial world (at our t=0) we have M(0) (=100) many languages, each 
of  which  is  spoken  by  randomly  chosen  Pi(0)  (≤10,000)  people;  thus,  the  initial  world 
population  (W(0))  is  about  500,000,  since  average  of  the  (homogeneous)  random  numbers 
between zero and unity is 0.5. Thus we assume power law zero for the initial distribution of 
languages over size, i.e., M(P) ∝ PP
   It is obvious that, we may not set our time origin correctly, because not a real data for the 
initial  time  is  available  to  match  with.  Yet,  we  may  assume  a  homogeneous  distribution  of 
size  over  initial  languages.  In  fact,  we  tried  many  smooth  (Gauss,  exponential,  etc.)  initial 
distributions  (not  shown);  and,  all  of  them  undergone  similar  time  evolutions  within  about 
3000 time steps, under the present process of random multiplication for growth, and (random) 
fragmentation  for  spread  and  origination  and  extinction,  where  we  utilized  various 
combinations of the relevant parameters, including H and G. We tried also delta distribution, 
which  is  equivalent  to  assuming  single  ancestor,  for  the  initial  case;  it  also  evolved  into  a 
slightly asymmetric log-normal one (with different set of parameters, certainly; not shown) in 
time.  In  all  of  them,  we  observe  that,  the  language  distribution  at  present  is  independent  of 
initial distributions, disregarding some extra ordinary ones. 
      Evolution  without  elimination  (G=1):  Number  of  languages  (M(t))  and  population  of 
world  (W(t))  increases  exponentially  in  time,  as  shown  in  Figure  1,  where  the  arrow  for 
languages (dashed line) has the slope 0.000095, and that for world population (solid line) has 
slope 0.002530, where the parameters are: R=0.00752 and H=0.0022, with S=0.49999 (others 
are same as before). 
   Within the present section we utilize 3000 time steps, as shown in Fig.1, where we consider 
the present time (the year 2000) as t=1920, which is indicated by a two sided arrow in Fig.1. 
We show the portion for 1920 <t<3000, because we will make some comments (predictions) 
for languages about future (and also for cities; since there are close relations between them). 
Please  note  that,  at  t=1920  (present  time,  the  year  2000)  we  have  7,168  languages  and  the 
world population is about 10 billion (Fig. 1). 
   Figure 2 is the time evolution of size distribution of languages (PDF), all of which split and 
grow by the same parameters, i.e., S, R, H (all same as declared in the third paragraph of this 

 

- 3 -

section), and G=1 (thus, we do not have abrupt (punctuated) elimination of languages here). 
Lower plot is historical (t=270, open circles) and upper one (squares) is for the present time 
(t=1920).    In  Fig.  2  we  observe  that;  initial  languages  spread  in  number  by  fragmentation, 
then  we  have  new  languages,  which  split  from  the  previous  bigger  ones  (right).  New 
languages emerge also from the small ones (left). And all of them grow in size in terms of a 
random multiplicative noise process. Growing rates are similar; yet, bigger ones grow (if they 
do)  in  bigger  amounts  at  each  time  step.  We  observe  that,  small  languages  grew  from  few 
decades  to  more  (yet  few)  decades  (with  a  time  period  of  1650  (=1920-270)  time  steps); 
whereas, the biggest language grew (within the same time period) from few tens of thousands 
to a billion as we observe at right end of Fig. 2 (Chinese, in reality). In the meantime world 
population grew (exponentially) from (about) half million to about 10 billion; and number of 
languages increased (exponentially) from (about) 197 to (about) 7,168. We have parabolic fit 
(dashed line) in Fig. 2, which indicates that the present distribution is slightly asymmetric log-
normal. (For the empirical distribution of the present languages; see, [1, and 2-3].) 
   We may summary our results, in some of which we utilized several other combinations of 
the  declared  parameters  (not  shown)  as:  1-  For  many  combinations  of  parameters,  we  get 
asymmetric log-normal distributions (for example, for H=0.003 (with R=0.00752, and S=0.1) 
about  70,000  languages  (not  7,000)  may  outcome;  not  shown),  where  asymmetry  may  be 
slight or more depending upon the parameters. On the other hand, as M(0) increases without 
changing other parameters, top of the plot for M(P) rises up; and as Pi(0) increases, width and 
the area (i.e., world population W(t)) under the plot increases, all for a given number of time 
steps. Please note that, M(0) and W(0) (i.e., sum of Pi(0) over i for 1≤i≤M(0)) is the amplitude 
of  the  (asymptotically)  exponential  function  M(t)  and  W(t),  respectively  (not  shown).  2- 
Increase in H, lifts the left end and top of the plot for M(P) and widens it for a given W(t), 
since we have more generated agents (due to high fragmentation) per time step. 3- Increase in 
R,  extends  the  plot  for  M(P)  along  two  directions;  i.e.,  it  widens  the  plot  at  left  (small 
languages)  and  at  right  (big  languages)  end,  since  we  have  more  rapid  growth  in  every 
language, where  mutated (split)  abundance  also increases.  In  short; we obtain various plots, 
which are more or less (or almost) same as the empirical data for the present languages, with 
different parameters. Our relevant comment is that, language distribution at present time may 
not be unique and similar ones may be obtained with various combinations of parameters for 
initial conditions and these for evolution, where range of each parameter used is considerably 
wide.  We  will  revisit  this  issue  in  section  3.3.  4-  One  important  observation  that  we  make 
within  our  results  is  for  1920<t,  i.e.  for  future:  For  a  given  asymmetric  log-normal  size 
distribution of languages for the present time; as t increases, asymmetry increases (where we 
keep  all  of  the  given  the  parameters  as  same,  and  increase  t).  Small  languages  end  rises  up 
with  decrease  in  local  slope  with  time;  in  the  meantime  local  slope  for  big  languages  end 
becomes more and more steep. In short, small languages end becomes the top of the plot for 
M(P), and big languages end turns to be power law with exponent about negative unity (see, 
Figure 2, the plot in open squares, where the slope for plot in solid squares (at tail) is –0.7). 
Thus,  we  have  power  law  with  exponent  zero  at  the  beginning,  we  have  power  law  with 
exponent (about) negative unity for future, and intermediately i.e., at the present time we have 
log-normal for size distribution. We will revisit the current issue in further paragraphs of this 
section and in sections 3.2-3.4, and 4. 
   Time distribution of languages, is another important issue, besides the size distribution. We 
consider here lifetime for the extinct languages and ages of the present ones. Figure 3 is the 
lifetimes of languages at present (t=1920, thick solid), past (t<1920, thin solid) and in future 
(1920<t,  dashed).  (Parameters  are  same  as  before.)  Here,  we  observe  that,  many  ancestors 
survive in all t; only two ancestor languages are found as mutated or having become extinct 
before t=1920. Secondly, generated languages are distributed exponentially (decreasing) with 

 

- 4 -

age, in both cases. Inset is the number of speakers for each of the living language at present 
time (which evolved out of the initial ones with random size.). The biggest present language 
(Chinese) is spoken by little more than one billion (1G, in the inset) human. 
   We obtained many similar results for the same parameters; yet, for different number of time 
steps; where, we observed that, the (negative) exponent remained same in results. Secondly, 
we tried the same number of time steps (as the one utilized within the previous case) and, we 
change other parameters. Considering these (new) parameters, which give similar PDF for the 
present  empirical  distribution  of  languages  over  size;  we  observed  similar  exponential 
behavior  for  distribution  of  emerged  languages  over  age,  where  the  (negative)  exponents 
depend  on  the  parameters.  Consecutively,  we  may  state  that,  generated  languages  are 
distributed  (decreasing)  exponentially  (independent  of  the  parameters  used)  with  age,  and 
(negative) exponents depend on the parameters. It is obvious that, increasing H (directly, and 
increasing  R  indirectly;  since,  any  size  hardly  becomes  less  than  unity  for  big  R)  promotes 
many  new  languages  to  emerge.  As  a  result,  linear  portions  of  the  plots  (left  end  in  Fig.  4 
which has logarithmic vertical axis for the number) becomes steeper; which means that, the 
exponents  increase  in  absolute  value.  There,  we  may  consider  the  situation  as  scaling  the 
(horizontal) time axis; where, increasing H and R, amounts to increasing the unit for a time 
step, and decreasing the number of time steps from the initial time (t=0) up to the present, and 
vice versa. 
   Elimination (G<1) plays a role, which is opposite to that of fragmentation (H) and growth 
(R) in evolution; where, H and R develop the evolution forward, and G recedes. So the present 
competition turns out to be one between H and R, and G. Number of languages are essentially 
determined by H and G, where two criteria are crucial: For a given number of time steps, R, 
and M(0), etc., there is a critical value for G; where, for Gcritical<G ≅1 languages survive, and 
for  smaller  values  of  G  (i.e.,  if  G≅Gcritical)  languages  may  become  extinct  totally.  Secondly, 
sum of H and G is a decisive parameter for the evolution: If for a given G (with Gcritical<G), 
H+G=1, then the number of languages does not increase and does not decrease, but oscillates 
about  M(0),  since  (almost)  same  amount  of  languages  emerges  (by  H)  and  becomes  extinct 
(by G) at each time step, and we have intermediate elimination. On the other hand, if H+G<1, 
then languages decrease in number with time and we have high (strong, heavy) elimination. 
Only for 1<H+G, (with G≠1) we have low (weak, light) elimination of languages, where the 
number increases (yet, slowly with respect to the case for G=1). It is obvious that, elimination 
slows down the evolution. It amounts to decreasing the unit for a time step, and increasing the 
number of time steps from the initial time (t=0) up to the present, and vice versa. So we need 
more time to  arrive  at  a  given  configuration of  languages;  i.e.,  total  number,  size,  total  size 
PDF, etc. 
   Now we introduce G=0.9996, with H=0.0022 (as before), where 1<H+G, and we have light 
elimination. We have the parameters (same, as before) for M(0) (=100, number of ancestors) 
and  Pi(0)  (≤10,000,  number  of  initial  speakers)  which  grows  with  the  rate  R=0.00752  (as 
before, Eq. (1)). At the end of 1920 time steps we have W about 13 billion and M about 3030 
(Eq.  (2)),  where  it  may  be  observed  that  light  elimination  is  effective  on  the  number  of 
languages rather than on world population. World population (W(t)) and number of languages 
(M(t)) increases exponentially (disregarding the abrupt and temporary recessions, not shown), 
with exponents 0.00235, and 7.8x10-4, respectively. Figure 4 is the resulting size and the inset 
is time distribution of languages at t=1920 (solid squares, for size); where PDF is smaller in 
height with respect to the one (solid squares) in Fig. 2. If we increase H to 0.0028 (keeping 
other  parameters  same  as  before)  we  observe  a  different  picture  (not  shown);  where,  small 
size end of the PDF plot is higher, since fragmentation is higher; yet, we do not have (small) 
languages spoken by few people. Many small languages are now spoken by some hundred or 
thousand  human,  at  minimum. Languages  move towards  right on the plot (PDF) for size as 

 

- 5 -

their speakers increase in number; and they move towards left as they fragment, and become 
extinct at the left end when they are spoken by no human. 
   Log-normal  plot  in  open  squares  for  t=3000  (future)  in  Fig.  4  is  clearly  asymmetric.  It 
involves a long tail for big sizes, and a short arm for small sizes, top of the plot is for about 
100,000 speakers, etc. Please note that, the plot with open squares in Fig. 2 is for G=1, and for 
t=3000 (for future), and the only different parameter here, with respect to the corresponding 
plot in Fig. 2 is G. Initial conditions are similar (not same, because we have random Pi(0)) in 
both cases, but evolution parameters are different; yet, the plots are similar in many aspects. 
First  of  all,  in  both  cases  we  have  higher  left  arm  (for  small  languages)  with  respect  to  the 
plots  for  the  present  time;  which  implies  that,  present  small  languages  will  decay  in  time, 
where punctuation increases the rate  for decay.  Secondly,  we  have  (decreasing)  exponential 
time  distribution  in  both  cases,  and  punctuation  (G≠1)  decreases  the  exponent  in  absolute 
value. As a result of punctuation, we may expect more people speaking a given language in 
future (due to some mechanism(s) else than fragmentation; for example, change of languages 
in terms of physical or cultural colonization, etc.), since top of the plot for future in Fig. 4 is 
lower  than  top  of  the  corresponding  plot  in  Fig.  2.  On  the  other  hand,  as  we  mentioned 
previously (two paragraphs before) that, presence of G<1 amounts to increasing the unit for 
time steps. So, the plot in solid squares in Fig. 4 may be viewed as one for future with smaller 
parameters  for  H,  and  R.  More  clearly;  if  one  utilizes  bigger  parameters  for  H,  R,  he  may 
obtain the target configuration for languages for smaller t, if, G=1.  And, since G<1 eliminates 
M(t) (randomly) we need bigger parameters for H and R, to mimic the size distribution, world 
population, size of the biggest language, and other empirical data. As a result, size distribution 
comes out with long tail for big size, and with short arm for small size. Moreover, sizes for 
small languages increase; i.e., we do not have languages spoken by few human, any more. 
   As time evolves, top of the PDF for size moves towards left, due to fragmentation (H), and 
tail becomes more and more crowded due to increase in population (R). As a result, we have 
two  configurations:  For  some H  (and  R),  we  have  (local)  horizontal  behavior  for  small  size 
(saturation) and we have a decline for big size, which becomes roughly straight (in many of 
our  runs,  not  shown).  Secondly,  for  bigger  H  (without  changing  R),  top  of  the  plot  rises  at 
small  language  end,  and  we  have  (roughly)  straight  distribution  for  many  big  languages  in 
log-log axes, which means that we have power law (see, paragraph 6 of sect. 3.1). 
   We  had  already  considered  age  distribution  of  the  generated  languages  as  (decreasing) 
exponentials in time for G=1, where age distribution for ancestor languages is delta function, 
i.e.,  same  (=1920)  for  all  of  the  ancestors.  And  now,  we  have  similar  exponential  time 
distribution for G<1, yet with smaller exponent in absolute value (not shown). Secondly, for 
G<1 number of living ancestors decreases in time with high fragmentation (not shown) and 
with  the  same  H  for  fragmentation  as  before  (not  shown),  where  we  have  only  32  ancestor 
languages present at t=1920, for G<1, with H=0.0022. 
   Please note that, ancestor languages may fragment at any time, t<1920; and they may give 
birth  to  new  languages,  where  size  may  vary  in  time  for  ancestor  and  generated  languages. 
We count these languages as ancestor, if their lifetime is 1920 (for 1920 time steps). Figure 5 
is the (time) distribution for lifetime of the languages, which became extinct; and, the inset is 
the relative frequency of events for extinction, all with G<1, where other parameters are same 
as before. 
   We  observe  that  the  distribution  for  lifetime  for  extinct  languages  are  also  (decreasing) 
exponential,  with  exponent  0.001  (as  given  by  an  exponential  fit,  not  shown).  As  a  result, 
more languages become extinct in their youth and less ones become extinct as they become 
old.  In  other  words,  languages  become  extinct  either  with  short  lifetime  (soon  after  their 
generation), or they hardly become extinct later and live long (which may be considered as a 

 

- 6 -

kind  of  natural  selection).  It  may  be  noted  that,  long  living  languages  have  many  speakers, 
and they hardly become extinct in terms of splitting. 
   Certainly,  we  do  not  have  any  empirical  record  for  time  distribution  of  languages  to 
compare  our  results.  Yet,  the  number  of  time  steps  we  utilized  (=1920)  may  correspond  to 
(roughly)  last  20,000  years  of  history;  with  the  initial  conditions  M(0)  (=100)  and  W(0) 
(=500,000). So, our time unit may correspond to about a decade in year; and, 10 to 100 time 
steps  (i.e.,  century  to  millennium)  for  a  given  (ancient)  language  to  become  extinct  may  be 
considered as reasonable. We count the number of extinct languages in Fig. 5 as 618 (about 
10% of the living ones), which may also be considered as reasonable. 
   Inset in Fig. 5 shows the ratio of languages which became extinct to the ones living at any t 
(0<t≤1920), where we observe cascades within extinctions, which decay in time. And, as time 
evolves,  cascades  disappear  and  we  have  a  constant  noise,  for  which  we  have  the  present 
(slightly asymmetric) log-normal size distribution (M(P)). 
   As the final remark of  this section we  note  that,  the  number  of  time  steps  which  we  used 
within the runs are 3000, 2430, 1920, and 270; and, they go in squares; i.e. with 30m2, where 
m=10, 9, 8 and 3, respectively. It is because, we observed that size distribution develops in 
(roughly) equal amounts in log-log plot; if, we increase our maximum number of time steps in 
squares. For example, consider Fig. 3; when we plot PDF for t=480 (m=4), 750 (m=5), 1080 
(m=6),  and  1470  (m=7)  they  fill  in  space  between  the  plot  for  t=270  and  t=1920  almost 
uniformly. And, if we continue for m=9, and 10, the mentioned uniformity survives. We think 
that,  evolution  of  language  distribution  for  size  may  be  running  in  steps,  which  are 
proportional  to  square  of  time  periods.  (Also;  see,  Figure  7,  where  number  of  ancestors 
decreases (roughly) uniformly with square of time.) 

3.2      Cities:  We  claim  that,  initial  world  is  not  (much)  relevant  for  the  present  size 
configuration of cities. Moreover, we may obtain similar configurations for various evolution 
parameters. In Figure 6, we display three PDF for size distributions, with different initial and 
evolution parameters, where the maximum population for ancestors (P=10,000), and splitting 
factor  (S=0.1),  is  same  (with,  G=1)  for  all.  Please  note  that,  S  is  not  the  maximum  value 
(which  is  0.5,  effectively),  since  we  think  that  any  number  of  human  may  change  their 
language,  yet  a  city  may  split  only  in  small  portions.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  known  that, 
minimum size for a language is unity but it is not defined for a city. A city may actually also 
be a village of single house, except if we demand a minimum population. For that reason we 
considered several minimum populations for a city. In Figure 6, slopes for linear fits (dashed 
lines) are about: 1) -1 (squares) 2) -1 (circles) and 3) -0.85 (stars). And,  utilized parameters 
are:  1)  (squares)  M(0)=100,  R=0.005,  H  =0.01,  number  of  time  steps=2430,  and  minimum 
population  for  a  city  =626);  2)  (circles),  M(0)=100,  R=0.0062,  H  =0.02,  number  of  time 
steps=3000,  and  minimum  population  for  a  city=740;  and,  3)  (stars)  M(0)=10,  R=0.005,  H 
=0.015,  number  of  time  steps=1470,  and  minimum  population  for  a  city  =1.  We  observed 
many  (other)  power  laws  about  minus  unity  for  several  (other)  combinations  of  parameters 
(not  shown),  where  we  observe  also  that;  a  very  wide  range  of  parameters  give  the  same 
Pareto-Zipf  law.  And  we  obtain  (decreasing)  exponential  time  distributions  for  lifetime  of 
extinct  cities  and  ages  of  the  livings  ones  for  big  M(0);  and  for  M(0)  less  than  or  equal  to 
(about) 10, the mentioned (decreasing) exponential distributions for lifetime changes in form. 
Please  see Figs.  3 and 4  for similar  distributions for  languages, and note that exponents are 
same for different t, which may be utilized to predict the terminal number for cities, and that 
for languages under some assumptions, as we will mention in section 3.3. 
   At  present  it  is  obvious  that  W(t)  and  M(t)  increases  exponentially,  due  to  R  and  H, 
respectively,  since  G=1.  For  Gcritical<G<1,  increase  in  M(t)  lessens,  and  for  Gcritical<G,  and 
G+H=1 we have oscillations in M(t) about M(0), which is not a realistic case, as the one for 
Gcritical≅G<1, where we have few cities at the end, and we do not consider them here.

3.3   Languages and cities: It is worth to emphasize that, languages and cities are no longer 
the  same  and  that  for  some  intermediate  times  the  cities  obey  the  1/size  law,  while  the 
languages obey the log-normal distribution, for the same (or better, similar) set of parameters. 
   As  we  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  time  distribution  of  cities  (lifetime  for  extinct 
cities  and  ages  of  the  livings  ones)  are  decreasing  exponentials  (disregarding  the  cases  for 
small number of ancestors) as shown in Figure 7. Simple probability (density) functions are 
also exponential (not shown), which means that cities occupy time distribution plots (Figs. 3, 
4,  and  7)  in  exponential  order;  more  cities  for  small  t,  and  less  cities  for  big  t,  for  a  given 
number of time steps in all. Inset of Fig. 7 is simple probability (density) function of living 
cities at t=1920, which is decreasing exponential with the rate (exponent) of 0.00185 per time 
step, where the number of living ancestor cities is 37 at present as shown by a solid square, 
which  is  far  from  the  curve;  and  they  (M(0),  say  about  1000  in  number,  at  most)  can  be 
neglected  within  some  hundred  thousand  cities  at  present,  if  ancestors  have  small  sizes.  On 
the other hand, we know that, size distribution for languages is not power law, for the present 
time. Yet, they display decreasing exponential time distributions (lifetime of extinct languages 
and ages of the livings ones; disregarding the cases for small number of ancestors) similar to 
the ones for cities. For random elimination case (punctuation) for languages (with G=0.9988, 
H=0.0022,  i.e.,  light  elimination  for  R=  0.0082)  simple  probability  density  function  (not 
shown,  similar  to  the  one  in  the  inset  of  Fig.  7)  is  decreasing  exponential  with  exponent 
(about) 0.0017, where the number for the youngest languages (i.e. these emerged within the 
last  19.2  time  steps,  since  we  divide  (horizontal)  time  axis  into  equal  100  parts  to  calculate 
probability) is 2430 for 1920 time steps, where decrease in the number of living ancestors in 
time (from hundred to about ten) is observable. 
   Now, we may represent the probability (density) function by μ(τ,t), where t stands for the 
number of time steps, and τ stands for ages of the languages at t, and μ counts the languages 
with age τ at t (with 0<τ ≤t). It is obvious that, the integral of μ overτ (with 0<τ ≤t) gives the 
number of living (not all, but) generated languages at t, which is equal to the number of total 
living  languages  (M(t))  minus  the  number  of  living  ancestors,  and  the  number  of  living 
ancestors goes zero with t(cid:198)∞. 
   In  Fig.  7  (and  in  many  others,  not  shown)  we  observe  that  exponent  (α,  say)  of μ(τ,t)  is 
independent of t, for languages and cities. Assuming that, the exponent (α=0.00185) for cities, 
will  remain  as  constant  for  t(cid:198)∞,  we  may  predict  M(t(cid:198)∞):  A  simple  integration  of μ(τ,t)= 
μ(1,t)exp(-ατ) over τ  (with 0<τ ≤t) can be performed for M(t), since living ancestors decay 
(in terms of fragmentation and random elimination) with time (M(t)=(μ(1,t)/α)exp(-αt)). The 
crucial parameter for the result is μ(1,t), i.e. number of newly generated languages or newly 
established cities at τ=1, for each t. It is obvious that μ(1,t) can not be constant or a decreasing 
function with t. Because we have elimination with G<1, and number of eliminated languages 
or  cities  increases  with  t;  languages  change  and  some  of  them  become  useless,  and  cities 
become old and ruined in time. μ(1,t) may be an increasing function in time, due to non zero 
fragmentation (H). If μ(1,t) increases linearly with time we get saturation in M(t(cid:198)∞), which 
is  not  contradiction,  since  we  have  elimination.  If  μ(1,t)  increases  exponentially  with  the 
exponent β,  we  have  saturation  in  M(t(cid:198)∞)  for β  =α;  and  we  have  M(t(cid:198)∞)=0  for β  <α. 
Since,  we  know  that,  at  present  M(t)  increases  with  time,  we  may  guess  that α<β  ;  i.e.,  we 
invent  new  languages  (and  establish  new  cities),  which  increase  either  linearly  or 
exponentially (with the exponent bigger than 0.0017 for languages and bigger than 0.00185 
for  cities)  in  time.  One  may  guess  that  M(t(cid:198)∞)  will  saturate  in  reality,  since  human 
population (for languages) and surface area of earth (for languages) is limited. 
   On the other hand, it is known that, cities were states in past; yet, it is not certain whether 
one language was spoken per city (state), or vice versa. For the present, we have about 7000 

 

- 8 -

languages at present for a world population which is little less than 10 billion (as mentioned 
within  the  first  paragraph  of  sect.  3.1).  For  the  size  distribution  designated  by  number  1 
(squares) in Fig. 6, we have about 110 thousand cities with a world population which is about 
5  billion  (not  shown).  So,  one  may  say  that,  a  language  is  spoken  within  15  city  on  the 
average, at present. Yet, it is not meaningful because of several reasons; one of which is that, 
we counted these as city, which have 626 citizens at minimum. And we do not know totally 
how many human are living in towns and villages, etc. But, it is obvious that we have much 
more cities than the languages in the present world. We have many metropolitan cities in the 
present  world,  where  only  one  language  is  spoken  by  big  majorities.  And,  we  have  many 
cities per country, where the number of languages is smaller than the number of cities, etc. It 
is  certain  that,  ratio  of  the  number  of  total  languages  to  that  of  cities  is  less  than  unity,  at 
present. 
   Thus far, we considered within various paragraphs that, languages and cities (as products of 
the same humans) are very similar to each other in many respects. Yet, languages and cities 
are no longer the same; and for some intermediate times the cities obey the 1/size law, while 
the  languages  obey  the  log-normal  distribution,  for  the  same  (or  better,  similar)  set  of 
parameters.  We  predict  that,  log-normal  size  distribution  may  turn  into  power  law  with  the 
same,  parameters  if  (only)  the  number  of  time  steps  is  increased  (i.e.,  in  future).  Moreover, 
languages  and  cities  have  (decreasing)  exponential  time  distributions  (lifetime  for  extinct 
cities and age for the livings ones). 
   In the next section, we will consider power law distribution for cities over size, where we 
will utilize big  number sum of (decreasing) exponential functions with independent random 
numbers for amplitude and exponent, and show that, the sum gives power law -1.

jk(x) = Ajexp(BBkbx)   .  

3.4      Sum  of  exponential  functions  with  random  and  independent  amplitude  and  exponent: 
Let’s  consider  exponential  functions  (zjk(x)),  where  the  amplitude  and  exponent  are  random 
and independent; for a real or complex number b, 
 
 
 
In Eq. (3), x is any independent variable; Aj is one random number Amin≤ Aj ≤ Amax and BBk is 
another random number BminB ≤ BBk ≤ Bmax which are independent of each other. In other words, 
we  select  A  and  B,  from  different  sets  of  random  numbers,  between  which  there  is  no 
connection. It is obvious that, real b may be taken as a scaling factor for x, or for BkB ; i.e., one 
may select b=1 for a unit of x-axis, and one may select b≠1 for a scaled unit of x-axis with 
x(cid:198)bx. And similarly; one may select b=1 for some BBmin and Bmax, and one may select b≠1 for 
B (cid:198)bBmin and BBmax(cid:198)bBmax. Now we take b in Eq. (3) as negative for positive BkB , (b(cid:198)-b), 
Bmin
thus we will have negative exponents. 
   Within a system we may have several physical quantities, which vary in proportion to zjk(x), 
or  to  derivatives  and  integrals  of  zjk(x).  Let’s  consider  one  such  function  yjk(x),  which  is 
proportional to zjk(x), i.e., yjk(x)= zjk(x), where the constant for proportion is taken as unity, for 
simplicity. We define, 
 

Y(x)=∑j

J∑k

K yjk(x)/JK   , 

 

 

 

(4) 

 
with some big yet finite J and K, where the order of sum is not important due to independence 
of the random numbers, and random numbers are generated homogeneously.  
   Inset  of  Figure  8  is  for  yjk(x)  (Eq.  (3))  with  b=0.1  and  Amin=  Bmin  =0.0,  Amax  =  Bmax=1.0, 
which  may  be  considered  as  size  distribution  for  languages  or  cities  along  x-axis,  where  x 
counts the agents (i.e., we place an agent (i+1) at x+1, if it is generated right after an agent (i) 
which is placed at x). Please note the present ancestors for small x. For the sum in Eq. (4), one 

 

- 9 -

may  select  the  random  numbers  same  for  all  x,  and  one  may  select  new  (different)  random 
numbers  at  each  x,  where  all  of  the  random  numbers  are  completely  independent  (Ai  is  one 
random number, Amin≤Ai≤Amax; and BBi is another random number, Bmin
) in all. Figure 
8 displays Y(x) (Eq. (4)) with J=K=1000, for Amin= Bmin =0.0, Amax ≤1.0, Bmax≤1.0, where we 
have no fluctuation in Y for the random numbers selected same for each x (dashed thick line) 
and fluctuation in Y increases in magnitude, as x increases (fluctuating plot) for the random 
numbers (re-)selected for each x. And, in both cases we have power law; as the arrow with 
slope -1 indicates in log-log axes. 
   Obviously, the important issue in Fig. 8 is that Y(x) is a power function for large x with the 
power of minus unity, i.e., 
 

B ≤BBj≤Bmax

Y(x)=∑j

J∑k

K yjk(x)/JK ∝ x-1   , 

 

 

(5) 

 
which is similar to Pareto-Zipf law, if x stands for city population. We may state that, if the 
probability of finding a city with population about x (say,  x±dx) decreases exponentially with 
independent random amplitude and exponent, then the sum of mentioned probabilities gives 
the famous power law. In other words, reason for the mentioned power law is the randomness 
in  amplitude  and  (negative)  exponent  of  the  probability  of  finding  a  city  with  population 
about x (say,  x±dx). Clearly, Eq. (5) is valid for every situation (competition between cities, 
that  between  languages,  and  similarly  between  speciation  and  extinction,  etc.),  if  it  satisfies 
the  given  conditions  (i.e.,  random  and  positive  amplitudes,  independently  random  and 
negative exponents). 
   For  homogeneously  (yet,  independent)  distributions  for  the  random  numbers  Aj  (for  the 
amplitudes)  and  BBk  (for  the  exponents),  with  Amin≤  Aj  <  Amax  and  Bmin
B ≤  BBk  ≤  Bmax,  one  may 
utilize the general theorem of central limit with large N or just convert the double sum into a 
double integral over A (Aj(cid:198)A) and B (BkB (cid:198)B), which vary linearly (since the random numbers 
are homogeneously distributed) between the extrema to obtain the following equalities: 
 

J∑k
Y(x)=∑j
      ∝ – (A2

Kyjk(x)/JK 
max – A2

min)[exp(–BBmaxbx) – exp(–Bmin

bx)]/(2bx)   , 

(6) 

 
and, for BBmin =0, we have  
 

Y(x) ∝ – (A2

max – A2

min)[exp(–BBmaxbx) – 1]/(2bx)   ,  (7) 

 
which may be further simplified, for 1«2bx; 
 

Y(x) ∝ [(A2

max – A2

min) /2b] x 

–1   , 

 

(8) 

 
since,  the  exponential  term  approaches  to  zero  as  x  increases.  And  the  result  is  power  law, 
with power minus one (Eq. 5). It is obvious that, BBmax may always be taken as unity, and b 
may be varied accordingly. We may state that, our analysis (Eqs. (5)-(8)) is general for any set 
of independent random numbers for amplitudes (provided Amax and Amin is finite) and that for 
exponents (provided BminB = 0, where BBmax =1 may be taken after changing b accordingly). (For 
some other applications of the present issue (in biology, for example); see, [8].) 
  As  we  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  this  section  that,  b  in  Eqs.  (3)-(8)  may  be  real  or 
complex.  It  is  obvious  that,  for  a  complex  (specifically,  purely  imaginary)  b,  Y(x)  may  be 
expressed in terms of sinus and cosinus functions, so we get oscillatory behavior in M(t) (Eq. 
(2))  for  G+H=1  for  example  (and,  similarly,  in  time  series  for  price  in  economy,  etc.). 
Furthermore, yjk(x) in Eq. (4) may be proportional to first (second, etc) derivative of zjk(x) in

Eq. (3), or to integral of it; where, we have more interesting cases, since then we have more 
than two random numbers in yjk(x). We consider these cases within Appendix. 
 
Appendix 

Power  law  for  harmonic  oscillation:      For  complex  b  (i.e.,  b(cid:198)±ib),  yjk(x)  =  Ajexp(±BBkbx), 
which  may  be  re-written  as  a  linear  combination  of  sine  and  cosine;  yjk(x)  =  Ajsin(BkB bx)  + 
A’jcos(BBkbx).  Then we have 
 

Y(x)=∑j

J∑k

K [Ajsin(BBkbx) + A’jcos(BkB bx)]/JK 

  , 

(9) 

 
 
which is similar to Eq. (9) in [9]. It is obvious that, not Y(x) in Eq. (9) but its envelope has 
power law -1, as the following equation implies 
 

Y(x) ∝ ±(A2

max – A2

min)[sin(BBmaxbx) ± cos(Bmin

bx)]/(2bx)   .  

(10) 

 
Power law with higher power:   Now, let’s suppose that yjk(x) is proportional to d(zjk(x))/dx, 
then we have three (at a first glance, it may be seen as two) random numbers (two of which 
are independent) in yjk(x) = bAjBBkexp(BkB bx), after taking the proportionality constant as unity. 
One  may  show  (after  a  similar  analysis,  Eqs.  (3)-(8))  that,  Y(x)  ∝  x–2.  Similarly,  if  yjk(x)  is 
proportional to d2(zjk(x))/dx2, then we have Y(x) ∝ x–3, etc. (For similar distribution functions 
for  price  in  economy;  where,  x  stands  for  the  relative  price  change  (more  precisely  for  the 
change in the logarithm of the price) one may see [10], and relevant references therein.)  
 
4      Discussion  and  conclusion:  Starting  with  random  initial  conditions  and  utilizing  many 
random  parameters  for  evolution,  we  obtained  many  regularities  (for  size  and  time 
distributions,  etc.)  under  the  process  of  random  multiplicative  noise  for  growth  and  random 
fragmentation  for  generation  and  extinction  of  languages  or  cities,  with  no  further  random 
elimination  (G=1).  We  find  that,  results  are  independent  of  initial  conditions,  disregarding 
some  extra  ordinary  ones.  If  we  have  G≠1,  we  need  longer  time  to  mimic  a  target 
configuration,  where  new  generated  languages  or  cities  may  be  inserted,  in  terms  of 
fragmentation,  provided  Gcritical≤G,  and  1≤G+H.  Furthermore,  many  languages  or  cities 
become  extinct  in  their  youth  and  less  ones  become  extinct  as  they  become  old.  In  other 
words,  languages  or  cities  become  extinct  either  with  short  lifetime  (soon  after  their 
generation), or they hardly become extinct later and live long (which may be considered as a 
kind of natural selection). 
   It is known  that, logistic  maps  (Eq.  (1))  are  dynamic, and under  some circumstances  they 
may become chaotic. We predict that, time distribution for languages or cities are (decreasing) 
exponential and log-normal size distribution for languages at present may turn into power law 
in  future.  Power  law  -1  for  size  distribution  of  present  cities,  may  be  result  of  (decreasing) 
exponential distribution of their probability over size. It is worth to mention that, finite sum of 
(decreasing)  exponential  functions  with  two  independent  random  numbers  (one  for  the 
exponent, and one for the amplitude) may be useful to express many relevant phenomena, as 
well in biology and economy. 
   In  summary,  languages  and  cities  are  not  the  same  and  for  some  intermediate  times  the 
cities  obey  the  1/size  law,  while  the  languages  obey  the  log-normal  distribution;  where  the 
decisive parameters are fragmentation rate (H) and splitting factor (S): We have smaller (H) 
and bigger (S) for languages with respect to these for cities, for the same population growth 
rate (R, which governs the world population, which is the same for languages and cities) and 
for the same set of other parameters.

languages  (M(t)),  Eqn.  (1))  (dashed).  Vertical  (two  sided)  arrow  (at  t=1920)  indicates  the 
present time (the year 2000), and the slope of the arrow for the world population (left axis) 
and  that  for  the  number  of  languages  (right  axis)  is  0.002530  and  0.000095,  respectively. 
Please note that the vertical axes are logarithmic.

Historical  (open  circles,  for  t=270)  and  present  (squares,  for  t=1920)  size 
distribution of living languages. (Parameters are given in sect. 3.1.) Dashed line is a parabolic 
fit indicating that, the present distribution is slightly asymmetric log-normal. For some other 
theoretical plots and for the empirical data; see, [1-3].) Outer plot is for future (t=1920).

Ages  of  living  languages  at  present  (t=1920,  thick  solid),  past  (t<1920,  thin 
Figure 3 
solid) and in future (1920<t, dashed). (Parameters are given in sect. 3.1.) Please note that, the 
number of generated (new) languages decreases exponentially with age, in all cases. Inset is 
the number of speakers for each of the living language at present time (which are evolved out 
of  the  initial  ones),  where  the  biggest  language  (Chinese)  is  spoken  by  little  more  than  one 
billion (1G, in the inset) human. Please note also that, many of the ancestor languages are still 
living, and few (only two) of them (out of initial ones, M(0)=100) became extinct in terms of 
fragmentation.

Figure 4 
Size distributions of languages: Solid squares are for the present time (t=1920) 
with  G  (≠1),  where  evolution  takes  place  under  light  elimination  of  languages  (See,  the 
relevant  text  for  the  other  parameters.);  and  open  squares  are  for  future  (t=2430)  with  the 
same elimination G (≠1) (other parameters are same as in Fig. 3.) Inset is the age distribution 
with G, at t=1920, where one may observe that, many ancestor languages are eliminated, and 
slope (exponent for the age distribution) is smaller than the ones given in Fig. 3 for G =1.

Y(x)  (Eqs.  (4-8))  with  I=J=1000,  for  Amin=  Bmin  =0.0,    Amax  ≤1.0,  Bmax≤1.0, 
where the oscillating plot is for Eq. (4) with the vertical axis on left, and with the vertical axis 
on right are: Solid plot, for the analytical expression in Eq. (7); and the dashed line, for Eq. 
(8). Please note that, vertical axes are shifted with respect to each other, yet units are same. 
Secondly, solid and dashed line has slope minus unity for large x. It is obvious that, oscillating 
plot  displays  power  law  minus  unity  (Pareto-Zipf  law)  for  large  x.  Inset  is  yij(x)  in  Eq.  (3), 
where two independent random numbers are used; one for exponent, and one for amplitude. It 
is  clear  that  yij(x)  may  be  utilized  for  size  of  languages  or  cities  along  x-axis,  where  many 
ancestors (for small x) are present. (See, the inset in Fig. 4, which is for 10 thousand agents.)
