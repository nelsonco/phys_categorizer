Abstract

We propose a precise deﬁnition of multidimensional ﬂuids generated by self-gravitating ex-

tended objects such as strings and membranes: a p-dimensional perfect ﬂuid is a smooth involutive

p-dimensional distribution on a spacetime, each integral manifold of which is a timelike, connected,

immersed submanifold of dimension, p – representing the history of a (p − 1)-dimensional ex-

tended object. This geometric formulation of perfect ﬂuids of higher dimensions naturally leads to

the associated stress-energy tensor. Furthermore, the laws of temporal evolution and symmetries

of such systems are derived, in general, from the Einstein ﬁeld equations and the integrability

conditions. We also present a matter model based on a 2-dimensional involutive distribution,

and it is shown that the stress-energy tensor for self-gravitating strings gives rise to a non-trivial

spherically symmetric spacetime with a naked singularity.

1 Introduction

The purpose of this work is to develop a general relativistic theory of multidimensional

ﬂuids as sources of spacetime curvature. The basic ingredients of such a ﬂuid are (p − 1)-

dimensional spatially extended objects called p-branes – where p = 1, 2, 3 correspond to point

particles, strings and membranes respectively. More precisely, a p-brane is a timelike, con-
nected, p-dimensional C ∞-manifold immersed in a spacetime – representing the temporal
evolution of a (p − 1)-dimensional extended object. Then, for a ﬁxed p, a multidimensional

ﬂuid is deﬁned by a smooth involutive p-dimensional distribution on a spacetime, each inte-

gral manifold of which is a p-brane. Thus, a multidimensional ﬂuid naturally generalizes the

model of a collisionless gas of point particles by a congruence of world lines (1-dimensional

manifold to another will be C ∞. Also, we deﬁne a spacetime as a non-compact, connected,
oriented and time-oriented n-dimensional manifold, M, endowed with a Lorentz metric, g.
For n = 4, the corresponding spacetime will be denoted (M 4, g).]

In a class of ﬁeld theoretic models1−4 of the early universe, p-branes appear as ‘topolog-
ical defects’ with characteristic rest-mass per unit (p − 1)-dimensional spatial volume. The

existence of such extended objects could be a possible source of density perturbations, and

hence may provide a causal mechanism for generating the observed large scale structure of
the universe5. Thus any scheme, based on general relativity, for investigating the role of mul-
tidimensional ﬂuids in the evolution of the universe, requires speciﬁcation of a stress tensor,

solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, description of the behaviour of other forms of matter

in the vicinity of the extended objects, and characterization of the resulting spacetimes and

their singularities.

In order to carry out this program, we need a precise form of the ﬂuid stress tensor, T,

which is formally a symmetric (0, 2)-tensor ﬁeld on a spacetime (M, g). Physically T replaces

and uniﬁes the concepts of energy density, momentum density, energy ﬂux and momentum
[An observer is a future-pointing timelike
ﬂux. These quantities are observer dependent.
curve γ : I −→ M (I ⊂ R is an open interval) such that ∀s ∈ I, the tangent vector
γ∗s ∈ Tγ(s)M satisﬁes g(γ∗s, γ∗s) = −1. An instantaneous observer (x, Z) at x ∈ M, is a
future-pointing timelike unit vector Z ∈ TxM.] When an instantaneous observer (x, Z) in
(M 4, g) measures, for instance, the energy density in any unit 3-volume of the local rest
space Z ⊥ ≡ {X ∈ TxM 4|g(X, Z) = 0}, T(Z, Z) corresponds to the measured energy density.

2

Also, for all known forms of matter T(Z, Z) ≥ 0, ∀ instantaneous observer (x, Z) (and hence
by continuity T(X, X) ≥ 0, ∀ causal X ∈ TxM 4) ∀x ∈ M 4. This operational deﬁnition
uniquely speciﬁes T in the following sense6:

If the symmetric (0,2) tensor ﬁelds T and T′ on a spacetime (M, g) satisfy

Theorem:
T(Z, Z) = T′(Z, Z) for all instantaneous observers (x, Z) then T = T′.

Hence measured energy density T(Z, Z) naturally motivates the following

Deﬁnition 1 : A stress-energy tensor on spacetime M is a symmetric (0, 2)-tensor ﬁeld T on

M such that T(X, X) ≥ 0 for all causal X ∈ TxM, ∀x ∈ M.

Based on the Theorem above, we shall motivate the deﬁnition, (1.3), of the stress tensor

for a collisionless gas of point particles (of mass m) in a way that is suitable for gener-
alization to multidimensional ﬂuids. Such a ﬂuid on (M 4, g) is a congruence of integral
curves of a nowhere vanishing (energy-momentum) vector ﬁeld, P, on a spacetime region –
where g(P, P) = −m2. This conﬁguration of (integral) curves is a 1-dimensional involutive
distribution on M 4 (or 1-foliation of M 4).

The above geometric structure of a particle ﬂow suggests that a collection of non-colliding
extended particles (non-intersecting p-branes) in a spacetime, (M n, g), can be modelled by a
p-dimensional (p ≥ 1) foliation of (M n, g) – where the timelike integral manifolds represent
the p-branes. After a brief introduction to foliations in section 2, we then characterise a
multidimensional ﬂuid, in section 3, as a p-foliation determined locally by a nowhere zero
decomposable p-form ω = σ( ˜V1 ∧ · · · ∧ ˜Vp)/µ where { ˜Va}p
a=1 are metric dual of local vector
ﬁelds {Va} giving (local) bases for tangent spaces of integral manifolds of the p-foliation,
det[g(Va, Vb)] = −µ2 6= 0, and σ is the characteristic rest mass per unit (p − 1)-dimensional
spatial volume of the p-branes satisfying G(ω, ω) = −σ2 6= 0. Here, G, is a scalar product on
the vector space of diﬀerential p-forms, Λp(M n) [see Appendix].

This local foliation p-form, ω, together with a density function η [(3.1)] allows us to

specify, locally, in a smooth way the number of p-branes of the ﬂuid system in spacelike

sections of a spacetime. Such a description of a multidimensional ﬂuid in terms of (ω, η)

naturally leads to the associated stress tensor [(3.15)] with the following local representation:

T = ηG(ιaω, ιbω)ea ⊗ eb

3

where, ιa, is the interior contraction operator on diﬀerential forms with respect to any local
basis vector ﬁelds {Xa} with the corresponding dual basis {ea}.

In section 4 we consider such a stress tensor as a possible source of spacetime curvature,

and derive its dynamical consequences from the Einstein ﬁeld equations. In particular we

have shown that the foliation p-form ω satisﬁes a ‘conservation law’ [Proposition 4] :

δ(ηω) = 0

and each integral submanifold (p-brane) determined by ω has vanishing mean curvature,

H = 0 [Proposition 3]. It is also shown that if the spacetime admits a Killing vector ﬁeld

K then the world density, η as well as ω are invariant with respect to the local isometry

generated by K [Proposition 1 and Proposition 2] :

LKη = 0 ;

LKω = 0

[Here δ and L are coderivative and Lie-derivative operators respectively].

These properties can be used to solve for the foliation p-form, ω, and the world density,

η, which specify the multidimensional ﬂuid as well as the spacetime metric. In section 5,

we have considered a matter model based on a 2-foliation where self-gravitating extended

particles do indeed give rise to a non-trivial spacetime with a naked singularity. A new class

of gravitational collapse problems is also presented.

1-Dimensional Perfect Fluids

In this subsection we motivate the deﬁnition of the stress tensor associated with an 1-
dimensional perfect ﬂuid (ﬂow of point particles) on (M 4, g), from the viewpoint of the
uniqueness Theorem stated above. For m ∈ [0, ∞), a particle of mass m is a future-pointing
curve γ : I −→ M 4 such that g(γ∗s, γ∗s) = −m2, ∀s ∈ I. Here m 6= 0 is the analogue
of Newtonian inertial mass and m = 0 is allowed. The vector ﬁeld, γ∗, over γ is called
energy-momentum of the particle. Then for an instantaneous observer (γ(s), Z), we have
the orthogonal decomposition of γ∗s ∈ Tγ(s)M 4 :

γ∗s = eZ + p

(1.1)

where e = −g(γ∗, Z) > 0 is the energy and p ∈ Z ⊥ is the momentum of the particle as
measured by (x, Z), and hence the Newtonian velocity of a particle with respect to Z is

4

given by v = p/e ∈ Z ⊥. Now, if we have enormous number of particles, each having the
same mass m ∈ [0, ∞) and the energy-momenta, then we may describe such a system on M 4
by the following

Deﬁnition 2 : An 1-dimensional perfect ﬂuid (P, η, m) on (M 4, g) consists of a function η :
M 4 → [0, ∞) called world density and an energy-momentum vector ﬁeld P : M 4 → T M 4
such that each integral curve of P is a particle of mass m, and the integral of the number

density 3-form

over a spacelike section D3 ⊂ M 4 deﬁnes the total number of particles in D3. Associated
with (P, η, m) is the stress-energy tensor

(1.3)

[Here ⋆ is the Hodge operator induced by the metric on M 4, and

P is metric dual of P.]

Remark: It follows from Deﬁnition 2 and the deﬁnition of a particle (of mass m) that P
is future-pointing and g(P, P) = −m2. Motivation for (1.3) : T is symmetric, smooth and
for all X ∈ TxM 4, Tx(X, X) = ηx[g(P, X)]2 ≥ 0. Thus T is a stress-energy tensor, by
Deﬁnition 1. We now explain in what sense the measured energy density is Tx(Z, Z) for
every instantaneous observer (x, Z) ∈ TxM 4.

Given an observer (x, Z), (1.2), by regarding part of TxM 4 (using exponential map) as
a part of M 4 for a suﬃciently small neighbourhood of x ∈ M 4, where curvature tensor is
negligible6. Then, given a set of linearly independent vectors X1, X2, X3 ∈ Z ⊥ (rest space
of Z), the world density function η can be interpreted as follows : the number of particles
measured by (x, Z) in the parallelopiped [X1X2X3] ⊂ Z ⊥ ⊂ TxM 4 is the number of integral
cuves of P crossing the parallelopiped [X1X2X3], and is (approximately) given by

|n(X1, X2, X3)| = ηx|Ω(P, X1, X2, X3)|

= ηxe|Ω(Z, X1, X2, X3)|

(1.4)

where Ω ≡ ⋆1 is the volume form on M 4, |Ω(Z, X1, X2, X3)| is the 3-volume of the
parallelopiped [X1X2X3], and from the Deﬁnition 2 and (1.1), P is given by the following
orthogonal decomposition

Px = eZ + p

(1.5)

An alternative way to calculate the particle number density in Z ⊥ is to project, nx [(1.2)],
into Λ3(Z ⊥) – the vector space of 3-forms on Z ⊥ – by the R-linear map,
ΠZ : Λ3(TxM 4) −→ Λ3(Z ⊥), where ΠZ = 1 +

Z ∧ ιZ. By (1.5),
e

Then the number of particles (x, Z) measures in any unit volume of the local rest space Z ⊥,
is given by

nZ ≡ ΠZ[⋆(η

P)]x = ηxe ⋆
e

e

knZk ≡ [G(nZ, nZ)]

2 = ηxe

where G [see Appendix] is the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, induced by g, on the
vector space Λp(M 4) of diﬀerential p-forms. From (1.5) and (1.7) we compute the energy
density U measured by (x, Z) :

U ≡ (ηxe)e

Thus T is a stress tensor for the particle ﬂow (P, η, m), and by (1.3), (1.5), (1.8) we have

Tx(Z, Z) = ηx[g(P, Z)]2 = ηxe2 = U

for every instantaneous observer Z. Hence Tx(Z, Z) is the energy density of the particle
ﬂow (P, η, m) – measured by (x, Z). Then, by the uniqueness property, the stress-energy

tensor for a particle ﬂow is indeed speciﬁed by (1.8).

2 Involutive Distributions (or Foliations)

In order to generalize the notion of particle ﬂows, we recall the following

Deﬁnition 3 : A p-dimensional smooth distribution D on a manifold M n is an assignment, to
each point x ∈ M n, of a p-dimensional subspace Dx of TxM n.

Remarks: The smoothness of D can be expressed in two equivalent ways :

(1) Every x ∈ M n has a neighbourhood Ux ⊂ M n on which there exists a set of smooth
(local) vector ﬁelds {Vα : α = 1, . . . , p} such that the vectors (Vα)y is a basis for the subspace
distinguished by the distribution Dy for every y ∈ Ux ⊂ M n. Thus {Vα} are said to span the
distribution, locally.

(2) Every x ∈ M n has a neighbourhood Ux ⊂ M n on which there exist (n−p) independent
smooth (local) 1-forms {θk : k = p + 1, . . . , n} such that θk|Dy = 0 for all y ∈ Ux ⊂ M n. Thus
{θk} are called constraint 1-forms for D. If D is locally spanned by {Vα}, then θk(Vα) = 0.

6

Now, an immersed submanifold Sp in M n is said to be an integral manifold (also called a
‘leaf’) of D, if at each point x ∈ Sp, its tangent space TxSp coincides with the subspace Dx of
TxM n. Then a distribution D is called integrable (or involutive) if through each point of M n
there is an integral manifold of D, and the necessary and suﬃcient condition (Frobenius’s
integrability condition) for D to be integrable is given by8,9

for some local functions f γ

αβ on M n. Or equivalently

[Vα, Vβ] = f γ

αβVγ

dθk = λk

j ∧ θj

for some local 1-forms λk

j on M n. An integrable distribution is called a foliation.

3 p-Dimensional Perfect Fluids

We recall from section 1 that a p-brane is deﬁned by a timelike, connected, p-dimensional

manifold immersed in a spacetime and is distinguished by a strictly positive parameter, σ -

the rest mass per unit (p − 1)-dimensional spatial volume. Thus, we introduce the following

Deﬁnition 4 : A p-dimensional perfect ﬂuid, (D, η, σ), in a spacetime (M n, g) consists of
a function η : M → [0, ∞), called world density, and a smooth integrable p-dimensional

distribution D on M such that each integral manifold of D is a p-brane of rest mass per unit

spatial volume, σ. If the independent local vector ﬁelds {V1, . . . , Vp} span D on the open set
U ⊂ M n and ω ≡ σ( ˜V1 ∧ . . .∧ ˜Vp)/µ where det[g(Vα, Vβ)] = −µ2 6= 0, so that G(ω, ω) = −σ2,
then the integral of the local number density (n − p)-form

n = ⋆(ηω)

(3.1)

over a spacelike (n − p)-chain C ⊂ U, deﬁnes the total number of p-branes in C.

Remarks:

(1) Locally, D is spanned by a set of vector ﬁelds {Vα : α = 1, . . . , p}, which forms a basis
for each timelike tangent space of each integral manifold (p-brane) of D. Then p-branes in
(D, η, σ) are locally characterised by a decomposable p-form on M n, χ ≡ ˜V1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Vp, with

(2.1)

(2.2)

(3.2)

(3.3)

ω ≡ σ( ˜V1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Vp)/µ

ω(p) ≡ ( ˜V1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Vp)/µ

7

G(χ, χ) = det[g(Vα, Vβ)] = −µ2

(3.4)

where µ is a strictly positive, real-valued, local function. The negative sign in (3.4) reﬂects

the timelike causal character of each integral manifold of D.

(2) In (3.3), the p-form ω(p) (hence, ω and n) is independent of the choice of the vector
ﬁelds {Vα} that span D, locally. Moreover, when restricted to a p-brane, ω(p) is the induced
volume form on the corresponding timelike integral manifold with G(ωp, ωp) = −1.

(3) A p-brane of rest mass per unit spatial volume, σ, is a timelike immersion with local
parametrisation φ : (0, 1)p → M such that for φ(s1, . . . , sp) = x ∈ M n, φ⋆(∂sα) = vα ∈ TxM n
and the p-form ω0 ≡ σ(˜v1 ∧ · · · ∧ ˜vp)/µ0 satisﬁes

G(ω0, ω0) = −σ2 6= 0

(3.5)

where det[g(vα, vβ)] = −µ2
0, and σ is the Newtonian analogue of inertial energy per unit
spatial volume of the p-brane10. We also recall that in a curved spacetime, a p-brane is
self-gravitating if φ is an extremal immersion (and hence, the mean curvature of φ vanishes).

Thus given a foliation of a spacetime (M, g) determined by a distribution D, the correspond-

ing multidimensioal ﬂuid, (D, η, σ), is locally characterised by the decomposable p-form ω on

M. In order to motivate the deﬁnition, (3.15), of a stress-energy tensor T for such systems,

we now give an approximate local analysis to obtain the energy density UZ with respect to
any instantaneous observer (x, Z) for all x ∈ M.

Energy Density UZ for (D, η, σ) :

For any x ∈ M n, let Ux be the neighborhood of x where (D, η, σ) is locally represented
by (ω, η), and consider a p-brane through x. Then, given an instantaneous observer (x, Z) ∈
TxM n, ω admits the following orthogonal decomposition with respect to (x, Z):

ωx = ˜Z ∧ (−ιZ ωx) + ΠZωx

where ΠZ ≡ 1 + ˜Z ∧ ιZ is the projection operator, ΠZωx is supported on (x, Z)’s rest-space,
Z ⊥ ⊂ TxM n in the sense that [ΠZωx](Z) = 0, and G( ˜Z ∧ (−ιZ ωx), ΠZωx) = 0. Now, for a
p-brane through x, its energy per unit spatial volume, EZ, with respect to (x, Z) is deﬁned by

(3.6)

(3.7)

EZ = [G(ιZωx, ιZωx)]

1
2

8

To motivate this deﬁnition, we look at the relevant properties of (p − 1)-form Θ ≡ ιZωx =
(σ/µx)ιZχx.

(a) From the equations (3.2) and (3.4) we have

where the (p − 1)-form χα is deﬁned by

Θ = (σ/µx)

(−1)α−1g(Vαx, Z)χα
x

p

X
α=1

χα ≡ ˜V1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Vα−1 ∧ ˜Vα+1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Vp

(3.8)

(3.9)

Note that one of the local vector ﬁelds, {Vα}, say V1, must be causal since the set (Vα)x
forms a basis for a timelike subspace of TxM. Then, g(V1, Z) 6= 0 since Z is timelike, and
hence by (3.8) Θ 6= 0. Since, ιZ Θ = ωx(Z, Z) = 0 and ωx is decomposable, the dimension of
the characteristic subspace8 of the non-zero (p − 1)-form Θ is (n − p + 1), and hence Θ is
also decomposable and can be written as

Θ = (σ/µx)( ˜Y1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Yp−1)

(3.10)

where {Y1, . . . , Yp−1} are linearly independent vectors in TxM. Now, ιZΘ = 0 and the linear
independence of the Ya’s imply

g(Ya, Z) = 0 ∀a = 1, . . . , p − 1

(3.11)

From (3.11) it follows Ya ∈ Z ⊥, and hence each Ya is spacelike and G(Θ, Θ) > 0.

(b) For any normal ﬁeld N where g(N, Vα) = 0 for all α, we ﬁnd ιN Θ = ιN ιZω = 0. Then
by (3.10) it follows that g(Ya, N) = 0 and hence each spacelike Ya also belongs to V p
x - the
tangent space of a p-brane through x ∈ M, which is spanned by the set of independent

vectors {V1x, . . . , Vpx}.

(c) From the above characterisation of Θ by (3.8), (3.10) and (3.11) it is now clear that the
non-zero (p − 1)-form Θ is constructed from a set of linearly independent (p − 1) spacelike
vectors, {Ya ∈ Z ⊥ : a = 1, . . . , p − 1}, which also belong to the (Lorentzian) tangent space
x of a (timelike) p-brane through x ∈ M. Thus in Z ⊥ ⊂ TxM n, the (p − 1)-plane formed by
V p
{Ya} [and hence ιZωx = (σ/µx)ιZ χx] represents the ‘spatial extension’ of a p-brane through
x ∈ M with respect to an observer (x, Z) and it follows that

AZ ≡ [G(ιZ χx, ιZχx)]

2 > 0

is the spatial volume of the p-brane in Z ⊥. Now, projecting the foliating p-form χ onto Z ⊥
[as in (3.6)] and using G(χ, χ) = −µ2 [(3.4)] we also have
−(µx)2 = −(AZ)2 + (QZ)2 - where

QZ ≡ [G(ΠZχx, ΠZχx)]

2 ≥ 0

1

is the volume of the p-plane spanned by {Vα}, when projected into Z ⊥. From the above
relation connecting µx, AZ and QZ we may deﬁne

and from (3.10) compute

γ(Z) ≡ (AZ/µx) = [1 − (QZ/AZ)2]− 1

[G(Θ, Θ)]

2 = (σ/µx)AZ

If an observer Z belongs to the tangent space V p
QZ = 0 and γ(Z) = 1. In this case we have

x of a p-brane, then ΠZωx = 0, and hence

[G(Θ, Θ)]

= σ

where Θ = ιZ ωx. Thus EZ ≡ [G(ιZωx, ιZωx)]
of a p-brane with respect to any instantaneous observer (x, Z).

2 is indeed the energy per unit spatial volume

Now, given an instantaneous observer (x, Z), we can ﬁnd a ‘suﬃciently small’ neighbor-

hood of x ∈ M [where curvature tensor is negligible] which (by exponential map) can be
regarded6 as part of TxM n. In such a neighborhood of x, we compute the ‘number density’
with respect to (x, Z) by projecting nx [(3.1)] into Λn−p(Z ⊥) [as in (1.5)]:

nZ ≡ ΠZ[⋆(ηω)]x = ηx ⋆ [ ˜Z ∧ (−ιZ ωx)]

(3.12)

where we used the identity ˜Z ∧ ⋆Ψ = (−1)k−1 ⋆ [ιZΨ] for Ψ ∈ Λk(TxM n). Then, with
respect to (x, Z), the number of p-branes of D intercepted by unit volume of an (n − p)-plane
in TxM n – orthogonal to the p-plane represented by the nonzero p-form ˜Z ∧ (−ιZ ωx) – is
approximately given by [as in (1.6)]

knZk ≡ [G(nZ, nZ)]

2 = ηx[G(ιZ ωx, ιZωx)]

(3.13)

Finally, taking the product of knZk in (3.13) and EZ [(3.7)] we ﬁnd the energy density UZ
(that (x, Z) measures) of the ﬂuid (D, η, σ) locally characterised by ω :

UZ = ηxG(ιZωx, ιZωx) ≥ 0

(3.14)

Stress Tensor for (D, η, σ) :

Now UZ is supposed to be equal to T(Z, Z) for every observer Z (see our discussion before
Deﬁnition 1) for any given form of the stress tensor T. Then the structure of UZ in (3.14)
suggests the following deﬁnition of the stress tensor T for a multidimensional ﬂuid (D, η, σ)

with the local representation

T = ηG(ιaω, ιbω)ea ⊗ eb

(3.15)

where {ea} are the local basis 1-forms (on M) dual to {Xb} such that ea(Xb) = δa
a, b = 1, . . . , n and ιa ≡ ιXa. It is clear that T is symmetric, and for any observer (x, Z)

b for

Tx(Z, Z) = ηxG(ιaωx, ιbωx)ea(Z)eb(Z)

= ηxG(ιZωx, ιZωx) ≥ 0

(3.16)

Then by continuity Tx(W, W ) ≥ 0 for all causal W ∈ TxM and hence T is a stress tensor.
Furthermore, the equations (3.14) and (3.16) show that the energy density UZ is equal to
Tx(Z, Z) for every instantaneous observer (x, Z). Hence by the uniqueness property, the
stress tensor for the ﬂuid, (D, η, σ), is speciﬁed by the equation (3.15). We also remark that
replacing ω in (3.15) by the energy-momentum 1-form, ˜P , reproduces the stress tensor for
the particle ﬂows.

The stress tensor T deﬁned in (3.15) for the ﬂuid (D, η, σ) can be written in a form which

is more suggestive as well as convenient for applications. From (3.4) we have

det[g(Vα, Vβ)] ≡ G( ˜V1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Vp, ˜V1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Vp)

≡ G(χ, χ) ≡ −µ2 6= 0

where we used the fact [see the deﬁnitions below (3.19)] that ˆgαβ is the inverse of the matrix
element ˆgαβ ≡ g(Vα, Vβ). ˆgαβ exists since by (3.17) ˆg is non-degenerate :

det[g(Vα, Vβ)] ≡ det[ˆgαβ] = −µ2 6= 0

(3.23)

Then from (3.22) and (3.23), restriction of the symmetric tensor ﬁeld ˆg [(3.21)] onto each

leaf Lp deﬁnes a metric on Lp - induced by the Lorentzian metric g on M. Since the leaves of
the foliation are connected and timelike, ˆg - restricted to a leaf - is also a Lorentzian metric

of constant index. Thus we have a simple interpretation of (3.20) that T is proportional to

a metric ˆg on each integral submanifolds, and from (3.20)-(3.21)

T = −ρˆg

(3.24)

where the positive function (on M), ρ ≡ σ2η, is the energy density measured by all observers
tangential to the leaves Lp.

As we mentioned earlier [see remark(2) below Deﬁnition 3 in section 2], a p-foliation of
an n-dimensional manifold may also be prescribed by (n − p) ≡ q constraint 1-forms {θi}
where θi(Vα) = 0 and by suitable linear combinations from the linearly independent set {˜θi}
we can get an orthonormal set of q normal ﬁelds {Nk} such that

Then the sets {Vα} and {Nk} together form a local basis for the tangent spaces of M and
{ ˜Nk} are the new constraint 1-forms satisfying the integrability condition (2.2). In terms of

g(Ni, Nj) = δij

g(Ni, Vα) = 0

4 Dynamics and Symmetries of Multidimensional Fluids

The stress tensor, T [in equivalent forms (3.15), (3.24), (3.25)], associated with a p-
dimensional ﬂuid is simply a symmetric tensor ﬁeld on (M n, g). However, if the spacetime
admits Killing vector ﬁelds, K, then T may acquire new symmetries through the Einstein

ﬁeld equation

G = T

(4.1)

where G ≡ Ric − 1
2gR is the Einstein tensor of the spacetime (M n, g), constructed from
the Ricci tensor Ric and the scalar curvature R. Since Killing vector ﬁelds generate local
isometries of (M, g), we have7 LKRic = 0 = LKR where LK is the Lie derivation with respect
to K. Then from the deﬁnition of the Einstein tensor G it also follows LKG = 0, and hence

by (4.1), LKT = 0.

Proposition 1: If K is a Killing vector ﬁeld and (D, η, σ) is a p-dimensional ﬂuid on (M n, g),
then the world density function η satisﬁes LKη = 0.

Proof: Taking trace of both sides of (4.1) with T given by (3.25), we ﬁnd

ρ = (

)(

− 1)R

p

n
2

(4.2)

where n and p are the dimensions of M and the distribution D, respectively. Since LKR = 0,
and ρ ≡ σ2η, it follows from (4.2) that LKη = 0. 2

Corollary 1: If T in (4.1) is the ﬂuid stress tensor T = −ρˆg [(3.24)], and K is a Killing vector

ﬁeld on (M, g), then LKˆg = 0.

Proof: Since LKT = 0, it follows that −(LKρ)ˆg − ρ(LKˆg) = 0. Then the corollary follows from
the fact that LKρ = 0, by Proposition 1, and ρ 6= 0. 2

We now discuss the signiﬁcance of Corollary 1 which suggests that the symmetries of a
spacetime (M n, g) are also the symmetries of the leaves {Lp} of a given foliation of M. First,
˜Nk ⊗ ˜Nk [(3.25)], the set {Nk} is

Proposition 2: If K is a Killing vector ﬁeld on (M, g), then LKω = 0, where ω ≡ σ( ˜V1 ∧
. . . ∧ ˜Vp)/µ - deﬁned by the foliating vector ﬁelds {Vα} - is the local representation of the
distribution D characterising a p-dimensional ﬂuid (D, η, σ) in a spacetime (M n, g), and
−µ2 ≡ det[g(Vα, Vβ)].

Proof: In terms of the spacelike orthonormal set {Nk}

ω = σ(−1)1+pq ⋆ ( ˜N1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Nq)

(4.4)

where ⋆ is the Hodge operator induced by the spacetime metric g and g(Nk, Vα) = 0 ∀k =
1, . . . , q ; ∀α = 1, . . . , p. Since for any Killing ﬁeld K, LK commutes with ⋆ and metric dual

operation

LK ⋆ ( ˜N1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Nq) = ⋆[LK( ˜N1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Nq)]

where Πj = ˜N1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Nj−1 ∧ ˜Nj+1 . . . ∧ ˜Nq. Now, using LKNj = X
k6=j

akNk from Lemma 1, it

follows that each term in the above expansion vanishes. Hence LK ⋆ ( ˜N1 ∧ . . . ∧ ˜Nq) = 0, and
by Lie derivation of (4.4) with respect to K we conclude that LKω = 0. 2

Now we derive the dynamical consequences of (4.1) with the foliating stress tensor [(3.25)].

First, we recall that the Einstein tensor G is divergence-free, ∇ · G = 0, and hence for any

stress tensor (4.1) implies ∇ · T = 0. In our case of interest, T is the stress tensor for a
p-foliation, given by [(3.25)] T = −ρ(g − P

˜Nk ⊗ ˜Nk). Then, we have

Proposition 3: For each integral manifold (p-brane) of the distribution, D, characterising a
p-dimensional ﬂuid (D, η, σ) in (M n, g), the mean curvature ﬁeld H = 0.

Proof: The proposition involves a local assertion. Since the distribution, D, is integrable,
for every point x ∈ M n there exists an integral manifold, Sp, passing through x, and (by
Frobenius Theorem) there is an open neighborhood of x, U ⊂ M n, where we may choose
an orthonormal moving frame X1, . . . , Xp, N1, . . . , Nq such that {Xa} are tangent to Sp and
{Nj} are normal to Sp. Since Sp is timelike, g(Xa, Xa) = ǫa = ±1. Then the mean cuvature11
vector ﬁeld H of Sp ⊂ M n has the following local representation:

H =

ǫag(∇XaXa, Nj)Nj

(4.6)

From (4.5), g(∇ · ˜T, Nj) = 0, which implies

Now, inserting the following expansion

∇ · (ρNj) = Nj(ρ) + ρ∇ · Nj

−Nj(ρ) + ∇ · (ρNj) + ρ

g(∇NkNk, Nj) = 0

Remark: By the above proposition, the equation of motion of a p-brane, S, in a multidimen-
sional ﬂuid (D, η, σ) is given by H = 0. Also, it can be shown13 that H and ω (the local
representation of D) are related by ιN dω|S = −g(H, N)|S, for every vector ﬁeld, N, normal
to the p-brane. Then H = 0 implies ιN dω|S = 0.

In order to derive a further dynamical consequence of (4.5), we need the following

Lemma 2: The world-density function, η, satisﬁes ιV (dη + ηλ) = 0, where V is any vector
ﬁeld tangent to the integral submanifolds of the ﬂuid, (D, η, σ) and λ is some 1-form.

Remark: Using the coderivative operator δ = (−1)n(k+1) ⋆ d⋆ on diﬀerential k-forms in a
Lorentzian manifold (M n, g), we can write d ⋆ (ηω) = 0 as δ(ηω) = 0.

Thus our program - of investigating a p-dimensional ﬂuids as a source of spacetime

curvature - would be to solve the Einstien equations (4.1) with the stress tensor T in (3.15),

and to specify g and (ω, η) – the local representation of the ﬂuid. In the next section we

shall work out a complete solution for a ﬂuid characterised by a 2-dimensional distribution
on a spacetime (M 4, g).

5 Spherically Symmetric 2-Foliation

As an application of our results in the previous sections we consider a 2-foliation (due to
string world-sheets) of a static spherically symmetric spacetime (M 4, g) where, in the local
chart (t, r, θ, φ), metric g is of the form

g = −h2(r)dt ⊗ dt + f 2(r)dr ⊗ dr + r2(dθ ⊗ dθ + sin2 θdφ ⊗ dφ)

(5.1)

Using an orthonormal basis (5.1) can be written as

g = −e0 ⊗ e0 + e1 ⊗ e1 + e2 ⊗ e2 + e3 ⊗ e3

(5.2)

where coframes are

with the dual basis given by

e0 = h(r)dt; e1 = f (r)dr; e2 = rdθ; e3 = r sin θdφ

(5.3)

X0 = (1/h)∂t; X1 = (1/f )∂r; X2 = (1/r)∂θ; X3 = (1/r sin θ)∂φ

(5.4)

such that ea(Xb) = δa

b. It is clear from (5.1) that (M 4, g) has four Killing vector ﬁelds :

K0 = ∂t

K3 = ∂φ

K1 = sin φ∂θ + cot θ cos φ∂φ

K2 = − cos φ∂θ + cot θ sin φ∂φ

17

(5.5)

Foliation 2-Form: If the spacetime speciﬁed by (5.1) is to be foliated by string world-sheets,
we must ﬁnd the appropriate 2-form ω ∈ Λ2(M) satisfying [Proposition 2]

LKiω = 0

(5.6)

where the Killing vector ﬁelds {Ki} are given in (5.5). The most general 2-form satisfying

(5.6), on the chosen spacetime[(5.1)], must be

ω = c1(r)dt ∧ dr + c2(r) sin θdθ ∧ dφ

(5.7)

Locally, ω is required to be decomposable, and for timelike foliation ω must satisfy G(ω, ω) <

0. These two constraints together with (5.7) uniquely (up to a scalar function) specify the

structure of the foliation 2-form so that

ω = c1(r)dt ∧ dr

(5.8)

(5.9)

Without any loss of generality we can normalise (5.8) by G(ω, ω) = −1, and the foliation

2-form is then given by

ω = h(r)f (r)dt ∧ dr = e0 ∧ e1

where we used the equations (5.1) − (5.4). It is now easy to see that the contraint form ⋆ω

satisﬁes the integrability condition [(2.3)]:

d ⋆ ω = −d(e2 ∧ e3) = (2/r)dr ∧ ⋆ω

(5.10)

Thus ω, indeed, determines a 2-foliation. Now, introducing string rest-mass per unit length,

σ, the foliation 2-form for the extended particle ﬂow (ω, η) is written as

ω = σe0 ∧ e1

(5.11)

Stress Tensor: From (3.15) and (5.11), the associated stress tensor is given by

T = ηG(ιaω, ιbω)ea ⊗ eb

= ησ2{G(e1, e1)e0 ⊗ e0 + G(−e0, −e0)e1 ⊗ e1}

= ησ2{e0 ⊗ e0 − e1 ⊗ e1}

(5.12)

where T is expanded in the orthonormal basis given in (5.3) and (5.4). The density function,

η, can be obtained from Proposition 4 and (5.11):

0 = d ⋆ (ηω) = −σd(ηr2) ∧ sin θdθ ∧ dφ

(5.13)

18

Then (5.13) implies ∂r(ηr2) = 0 and hence ηr2 is constant. Thus the density function for
2-foliation is given by

η = c/r2

(5.14)

where c is some positive constant since η is deﬁned to be positive.

Solution to Einstein’s Equations: For complete speciﬁcation of the string-ﬁeld ﬂow we must

ﬁnd the functions h(r) and f (r) from the Einstein equation (4.1) with the stress tensor in

(5.12). For convenience (4.1) is written in the following form :

Pa = Tabeb − (Γ/2)gabeb

(5.15)

where Pa ≡ Ric(Xa, Xb)eb are the Ricci 1-forms, and Γ ≡ traceT = −2ησ2 by (5.12). Now,
computing the Ricci forms with respect to an orthonormal basis[(5.3), (5.4)], we ﬁnd

P0 = (1/f 2)[(h′′/h) − (h′/h)(f ′/f ) + (2/r)(h′/h)]e0
P1 = −(1/f 2)[(h′′/h) − (h′/h)(f ′/f ) − (2/r)(f ′/f )]e1
P2 = [(1/rf 2){−(h′/h) + (f ′/f )} + (1/r2){1 − (1/f 2)}]e2
P3 = [(1/rf 2){−(h′/h) + (f ′/f )} + (1/r2){1 − (1/f 2)}]e3

From (5.2), (5.12), (5.15) and deﬁning ρ ≡ ησ2, we also have

P0 = 0; P1 = 0; P2 = ρe2; P3 = ρe3

Then (5.16) and (5.17) imply

(h′′/h) − (h′/h)(f ′/f ) + (2/r)(h′/h) = 0

(h′′/h) − (h′/h)(f ′/f ) − (2/r)(f ′/f ) = 0

(1/rf 2){−(h′/h) + (f ′/f )} + (1/r2){1 − (1/f 2)} = ρ

To solve these equations, ﬁrst, we note that subtracting (5.19) from (5.18) gives

Integrating (5.21) and choosing the integration constant to be 0, we have

Now inserting (5.21) in (5.18) and deﬁning a(r) ≡ h2(r) we get

(h′/h) + (f ′/f ) = 0

hf = 1

a′′ + (2/r)a′ = 0

The general solution to (5.23) is found to be

a(r) ≡ h2(r) = (β − 2m/r)

where β and m are constants with m > 0. Then using (5.21), (5.22) and (5.24) in the

equation (5.20) we ﬁnd

It is clear from (5.25) that

Hence for non-vanishing string ﬁeld ﬂow (ω, η), the constant β can not be equal to 1. Com-
paring (5.25) with (5.14) and using ρ ≡ ησ2 we also have

(1/r2)(1 − β) = ρ

β 6= 1 ⇔ ρ 6= 0

β = 1 − cσ2

Collecting our results in (5.22), (5.24) and (5.27) the spacetime metric [(5.1)] is now given

by

g = −(1 − cσ2 − 2m/r)dt ⊗ dt + (1 − cσ2 − 2m/r)−1dr ⊗ dr

+r2(dθ ⊗ dθ + sin2 θdφ ⊗ dφ)

and from (5.22) the foliating 2-form ω[(5.11)] takes the following form :

ω = σdt ∧ dr

Thus the equations (5.28), (5.29) and (5.14) completely determine the local ﬂow of a 2-

dimensional ﬂuid generated by radial strings in a static spherically symmetric spacetime. The

metric in (5.28) may be interpreted as representing a spacetime associated with a particle of

mass m (at r = 0) surrounded by spherically symmetric distribution of strings with density
η = c/r2 [(5.14)].

Properties of the Solution (5.28) :

(a) For cσ2 < 1, this solution has a horizon of radius

r0 = 2m/(1 − cσ2)

(5.30)

The equation (5.30) shows that the Schwarzschild radius for the mass m is enhanced by a
factor (1 − cσ2)−1 > 1.

20

(b) For m = 0, there is no horizon but the spacetime has a naked singularity at r = 0.

To see this, we substitute p = 2 (dimension of foliation) and n = 4 (spacetime dimension)

in (4.2) to ﬁnd the Ricci (scalar) curvature :

R = 2cσ2/r2

(5.31)

We also compute an invariant scalar constructed from the curvature 2-forms Rab, where
a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3 :

⋆(Rab ∧ ⋆Rab) = 24m2/r6 + 8m(cσ2)/r5 + 2(c2σ4)/r4

(5.32)

Besides the existence of the singularity at r = 0, (5.31) and (5.32) also imply that the

spacetime remains curved with m = 0 - that is - with the foliating strings alone, and the
metric, (5.28), remains well-behaved even with m = 0 and cσ2 = 1.

(c) Using (5.2), if we rewrite the foliation stress tensor, (5.12), in the form, T = −ρ(g −

e2 ⊗ e2 − e3 ⊗ e3), then for any causal vector V we have

T(V, V ) = −ρ{g(V, V ) − [g(X2, V )]2 − [g(X3, V )]2}

≥ −ρg(V, V ) = (1/2)(traceT)g(V, V )

(5.33)

where we have used the inequalities ρ ≥ 0 and g(V, V ) ≤ 0. The equation (5.33) shows that
the stress tensor (5.12) satisﬁes the strong energy condition, and this also means that the

gravitational ﬁeld - generated by the foliating string world-sheets - is attractive.

Thus the ﬂuid of string world-sheets gives rise to a non-trivial solution (to Einstein’s

equations) - which is non-ﬂat, static and spherically symmetric with a naked singularity.

Such a network of line-like objects could be used to model a multilayer star where the

constituents of each layer follows diﬀerent equation of state.

Modelling Star with 2-Foliation :

Following a suggestion in reference [12], we consider a two-layer star in which the core

consists of a (spatially isotropic) perfect ﬂuid, and the exterior is formed by a spherically

symmetric distribution of strings as in (5.29). Thus the stress tensor for the core is given by

Tc = (ρc + ν)˜u ⊗ ˜u + νgc

(5.34)

where u is a unit timelike vector ﬁeld - called ﬂow vector ﬁeld, ρc is the density of the
core and taken to be a constant, and ν is the spatially isotropic pressure function. Then,

21

in the chart (t, r, θ, φ), the metric tensor gc for the core of radius rc is given by a special
case (ρc ≡ constant) of the well-known Oppenheimer-Volkov14 solution to the Einstein ﬁeld
equations :

[(5.28)] :

The metric for the spacetime region foliated by the radial strings [(5.29)] is taken as

gs = −(1 − q − 2m/r)dt ⊗ dt + (1 − q − 2m/r)−1dr ⊗ dr

+r2(dθ ⊗ dθ + sin2 θdφ ⊗ dφ)

(5.37)

where q ≡ cσ2 [from (5.28)] is a positive constant. In (5.37) we require r ∈ (rc, rs) with rs
as star-radius, and rs > rc. For r > rs, we have the Schwarzschild vacuum metric :

gv = −(1 − 2mv/r)dt ⊗ dt + (1 − 2mv/r)−1dr ⊗ dr

+r2(dθ ⊗ dθ + sin2 θdφ ⊗ dφ)

To complete our model we need to match these metrics continuously across the boundaries

of diﬀerent layers. The matching condition for gs and gc at r = rc is given by gs

= gc

and hence from (5.35) and (5.37) we have

Similarly, from (5.37) and (5.38), the continuity of gs and gv at r = rs implies

2mv = 2m + qrs =

responding metrics [(5.35), (5.37) and (5.38)] are static and free from any singularities. We

also remark that (5.41) naturally follows from the condition that prohibits gravitational col-

lapse of the core. To see this, ﬁrst we note that the pressure ν = 0 at the core-surface r = rc,

The right side of (5.44) can be easily seen to be an increasing function of the central pressure

rc with the given density ρc, and hence

The above inequality provides the validity of the condition (5.41) which leads to the model

of a non-collapsing star with spherically symmetric distribution of strings.

Our discussion on 2-foliation suggests that a complete general-relativistic theory of mul-

tidimensional perfect ﬂuids may enable us to investigate a new class of collapse problems,

the possible formation of horizons and the nature of the associated singularities.

6 Conclusion :

We emphasize that the results in this paper strictly follow from the concepts intro-

duced in Deﬁnition 4 which oﬀer a precise description of p-dimensional ﬂuids. Consequently,
the foliation p-form ω [with G(ω, ω) < 0] together with the uniqueness property of stress-

energy tensors directly lead to our formulation of the dynamics and symmetries of such

self-gravitating systems. Then the local decomposable p-form ω which deﬁnes a timelike
p-foliation of a spacetime and the world density function η, enable us to introduce the local

number-density [(3.1)] of the leaves of the foliation. They also give rise to the concept of
spatial volume (and energy) of a p-brane with respect to any observer [remarks (a), (b) and

(c) after (3.7)]. These two ingredients then naturally motivates a precise deﬁnition of the

stress-energy tensor T[(3.15)] for multidimensional perfect ﬂuids.

It is interesting to observe, from the equation [(4.2)] relating trace(T) and the the scalar
curvature R, that a 2-dimensional spacetime (n = 2) does not admit any massive particle

(p = 1) ﬂow, however, only massless ﬂows are consistent with the ﬁeld equations. In fact, a

slight modiﬁcation of our Deﬁnition 4 permits construction of null foliations, where ω satisﬁes

G(ω, ω) = 0.

Furthermore, ω provides the local description of the dynamics [Proposition 3 and Propo-

sition 4] of p-branes and carries the symmetries [Proposition 1 and Proposition 2] of a foliated

spacetime, and we have demonstrated, in section 5, that the spacetime symmetries determine

to a large extent the structure of foliations [(5.7)] and hence the associated stress tensor.

This example suggests the posssibility of other non-trivial solutions to the Einstein equations

in a spacetime region dominated by extended objects like strings and membranes.

Appendix : Deﬁnition of G

Given a semi-Riemannian manifold (M n, g), the symmetric bilinear form G on the vector
space Λp(M) of diﬀerential p-forms on M is, ﬁrst, deﬁned9 on decomposable p-forms and then
the deﬁnition is extended to any p-forms by linearity. Consider two decomposable p-forms

Θ = α1 ∧ . . . ∧ αp

; Φ = β1 ∧ . . . ∧ βp

where αi, βi ∈ Λ1(M). Then, by deﬁnition, G(Θ, Φ) ≡ det[g( ˜αi, ˜βj)] – where ˜α is the metric
dual of the 1-form α. Now, for any pair of p-forms ω and χ, G has the following useful

Θ and Φ given by

properties :

ω ∧ ⋆χ = G(ω, χ) ⋆ 1 ; G(⋆ω, ⋆χ) = (−1)sG(ω, χ)

where ⋆1 is the volume form on M induced by the metric g, and s is the index of g.
