We consider an isolated gaseous system, divided in two parts by an
adiabatic  movable  frictionless  internal  wall  undergoing  Brownian
motion. We show how this kind of motion can lead to a substantial
decrease  of  the  system  entropy.  This  surprising  result  does  not
violate  Boltzmann's  H-theorem  since 
the  molecular  chaos
assumption underlying H-theorem is not fulfilled by our system.

 It  is  generally  assumed  that  -in  accordance  with  the  Second  Law  of
thermodynamics- the entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease.  The
Second  Law  finds  its  most  natural  conceptual  basis  in  Boltzmann's  H-
theorem,  according  to  which  complete  molecular  chaos  is  a  sufficient
condition  for  its  validity  [1].  In  the  present  paper,  we    will  consider  a
particular  isolated  system  for  which  the  standard  molecular  chaos
assumption is not true and we will show how this system can undergo a
relevant entropy decrease, thus violating the Second Law.
We refer to the case of an adiabatic cylinder containing 2n moles of the
same  perfect  gas  separated  into  two  parts  A  and  B  (each  containing  n
moles)    by  a  movable,  frictionless,  adiabatic  piston  [2].    The  piston  is
held  by  latches  and  the  initial  equilibrium  states  in  A  and  B  are
respectively characterized by temperatures T1(0) + TA , T2(0) + TB , and
volumes VA = SX(0), VB = S[L-X(0)] , where S and L are the transverse
area and the length of the cylinder, and X(0) labels the piston position.
At time t=0, we release the latches and we assume the piston to slide in
the cylinder without friction (see Fig.1).

The  problem  of  predicting  the  final  equilibrium  state  of  the  system  is
indeterminate  from  a  purely  thermodynamic  point  of  view.  Actually,
equilibrium thermodynamics only allows one to determine the common
final  pressure  Pf  of  the  two  gases.  In  fact,  the  equality  of  the  final
equilibrium  pressures  in  A  and  B  yields  Pf=nR(T1f/V1f)=nR(T2f/V2f),
where T1f , V1f and  T2f  , V2f are the final temperatures and volumes in
A  and  B,  respectively,  while  energy  conservation  for  a  perfect  gas  is
expressed by the relation T1f +T2f=TA+TB. From these two relations it is
immediate to deduce Pf=nR(T1f/V1f)(1+T2f/T1f)/(1+V2f/V1f), so that the
final pressure is given by Pf=nR(TA+TB)/(VA+VB), but  T1f , V1f , T2f,
V2f    cannot  be  determined  separately.  In  other  words,  the  considered
system is peculiar in  that  one  cannot  predict the final temperatures and
volumes by means of elementary thermodynamics. This is related to the
presence of the infinite set of contiguous equilibrium states obeying the
above relations.
While the  indetermination  of  final  volumes  and  temperatures  holds  in
the  realm  of  elementary  thermodynamics,  a  recent  dynamical  analysis
[3] shows the possible existence of a well-defined final equilibrium point

3

dependent  on  the  initial  conditions  and  allows  one  to  investigate  the
dynamical  evolution  toward  this  point.  More  precisely,  under  the
assumption  that  the  two  gases  in  A  and  B  achieve  thermal  equilibrium
over a time scale negligible with respect to that of the piston motion, the
instantaneous  state  of  the  system  is  described  by  the  set  of  evolution
equations [3]

where  T1  ,  T2  and  X  label  the  temperature  in  A,  the  one  in  B  and  the
piston position as functions of time, and the quantities R, cv, Mg and M
represent the molar gas constant, the molar heat at constant volume, the
common value of the gas masses in A and B, and the piston mass, and
the dot denotes derivation with respect to time.
  The  set  of  Eqs.(1),  (2),  and  (3)  implies  that  piston  position  and
temperatures  reach  asymptotic  values  Xf,  T1f,  T2f  dependent  on  the
initial  conditions,  such  that    T1f  +T2f  =TA  +TB  (energy  conservation)
and  T1f/ Xf= T2f/(L-Xf) (equal final pressure in A and B).
We  note  that  our  dynamical  model  described  by  the  coordinates  X(t),
T1(t) , T2(t)  does not lend itself to a Hamiltonian description. In order to
get  a  physical  insight  about  this  statement,  let  us  vary  in  all  possible
ways  the  initial  temperature    TA  and,  in  correspondence,  TB  ,  so  to
maintain the fixed value TA+TB+2T0 .  In this way, the initial conditions
determined  by  X(0),  TA  span  the  square  depicted  in  Fig.2,  while  the
asymptotic  values    Xf,  T1f  lie  on  the  diagonal  ,  corresponding  to  the
equilibrium  pressure    Pf  (see  Eq.(3)).  Therefore,  an  initial  phase-space
surface reduces to a final attractor of vanishing area, so that the phase-
space  area  is  not  conserved  as  it  should  be  for  a  Hamiltonian  system
(Liouville's theorem).

The  above  discussion  refers  to  the  dynamical  evolution  of  the  system
toward a point on the equal-pressure equilibrium line (i.e., the attractor
corresponding  to  the  diagonal  of  Fig.  2),  starting  from  an  initial
nonequilibrium  state.  In  this  paper,  we  wish  to  consider  the  further
system  evolution  that  takes  place  starting  from  a  point  on  the
equilibrium  line.  This  evolution,  associated  with  an  extremely  slow
Brownian-like motion of the piston, essentially corresponds to a random
wandering of the gas state in A ( and B) along the equilibrium line. This
wandering is made possible by the fact that, due to pressure equality in A
and  B,  the  piston  is  acted  upon  by  a  very  weak  restoring  force.  In  the
following, we will place into evidence how, during this process, the total
entropy of the isolated system can substantially decrease.

We  will  consider,  in  particular,  the  case  in  which  the  initial  piston
position is X(0)=L/2 and the initial common temperature in A and B is
T0=(TA+TB)/2  ,  corresponding  to  maximum  entropy.  During  the
transformation from this state to a final one corresponding to a generic X
along  the  equilibrium  line,  both  gases  maintain  the  common  constant
pressure  Pf,  so  that  T1/X=T2/(L-X)=2T0/L.  The  total  entropy  change
D S(X)= D S1(X)+ D S2(X)=S(X)-S(L/2) is given by

an  estimate  for  the  value  attained  by  <X2>  in  an  asymptotic  time  tas.
Once inserted into Eq.(4), we will show how it can give rise to a value of
|D S|  much  larger  than  that  associated  with  ordinary  thermal  entropy-
fluctuations,  that  is  the  ones  present  in  a  gas  at  thermal  equilibrium
where any departure from equilibrium itself is strongly damped on a very
short time scale.

where A(t) is the fluctuating Langevin's acceleration associated with the
random molecular hits suffered by the piston. We note that Eq.(5) differs
from Eq.(3) for the presence of A(t) and for the absence of the first term
on  the  R.H.S.  of  Eq.(3).  Actually,  this  contribution  vanishes  since  the
system  is  on  the  (equal-pressure)  equilibrium  line,  but  the  Langevin
acceleration A(t) , which was obviously negligible far from equilibrium,
can be no longer ignored. Without the term A(t), the  structure of Eq.(5)
would imply the piston to remain at rest after having reached with zero
velocity a position on the equilibrium line obtained by solving the set of
Eqs.(1)-(3).  Actually,  the  presence  of  A(t)  is  now  the  main  responsible
for  the  stochastic  motion  of  the  piston.  Correspondingly,  our  system
undergoes  a  slow  random  wandering  along  the  states  characterized  by
the common pressure Pf of the two gases (see Fig.2), so that these states
should be more properly termed quasi-equilibrium states. We wish now
to investigate the stochastic piston motion. By exploiting the equilibrium
pressure relation T1/X=T2/(L-X)=2T0/L (now valid at all times), Eq.(5)
can be rewritten as

 The nonlinear stochastic Eq.(7) contains a friction term opposite to the
(cid:6)X   and  a  term  driving  the  piston  toward  the  particular

piston  velocity 
quasi-equilibrium position X=L/2 characterized by maximum entropy.

While  solving  Eq.(7)  is  a  formidable  task,  the  basic  aspects  of  the
piston dynamical evolution can be obtained by approximating the square
of  the  piston  velocity  with  its  average  thermal  value  at    temperature
(cid:6)X2 =KT0/M, where K is Boltzmann's constant. In effect,
(TA+TB)/2, i.e., 
the restoration term in Eq.(7) does not depend on the sign of the velocity
,  and  the  above  approximation  does  not  significantly  alter  its  role  in
determining the most significant consequences of  Eq. (7). Proceeding in
this way, Eq. (7) is superseded by

 Equation (8) is in a significant form in that it describes the Brownian
motion of a body of mass M (i.e., the piston) in a harmonic field of force
driving  the  piston  to  the  position  X=L/2,  a  case  which  has  been
exhaustively discussed by Chandrasekhar [4]. More precisely, the author
deals  with    the  theory  of  Brownian  motion  of  a  harmonically  bound
particle  of  mass  m  described  by  the  equation  (cid:6)(cid:6)
  (see
Eq.  (187)  of  Ref.[4]).  By  solving  the  stochastic  equation,  he  is  able  to
prove  that  < x2 >

These  results  can  be  transferred  to  Eq.(8)  if  we  take  x=X-L/2,  and

obviously  exceed  L/2,  we  can  only  deal  with  the  case  M/2Mg<1
(actually,  the  hypothesis  of  small  oscillations  of  the  piston  around  the
position  X=L/2  ,  expedient  to  pass  from  Eq.(6)  to  Eq.(7),  requires  that
M/2Mg<<1).

We will now give an estimate of the asymptotic entropy decrease if the
initial piston position is X(0)=L/2, corresponding to maximum entropy.
In order to evaluate the  asymptotic value D Sas of the entropy change in
a rigorous way, one should perform the ensemble average of Eq.(4) with
the  appropriate  asymptotic  probability  distribution  (see  Eq.(213)  of
Ref.[4]). Actually, for the purpose of obtaining an order of magnitude of
D Sas , it is sufficient to substitute on the R.H.S. of Eq.(4) X and X2 with
<X>Av = L/2 and <X2>Av = L2(1+M/2Mg)/4 (see Eq.(9)), which yields

The quantitative relevance of the above negative entropy variation can
be  appreciated  by  comparing  it  with  the  standard  entropy  fluctuations
D Sth taking place in a gas at thermal equilibrium. To this aim, we recall
the  well-known  result  according  to  which  D Sth
  is
given by (Kncp)1/2 [5], so that we can write, with the help of Eq.(10) and

It is important to explore why the entropy decrease  is in our case much
larger  than  that  associated  with  thermal  fluctuations.The  reason  is
essentially two-fold:

thermally  conducting  one, 

1.  In  most  cases,  thermal  equilibrium  corresponding  to  maximum
entropy  is  maintained  under  the  competing  influences  of  equilibrium-
disturbing  Langevin  forces  and    macroscopic  restoration  forces  driving
the  system  back  to  equilibrium;  for  example,  if  we  substitute  the
adiabatic  piston  with  a 
its  random
displacements  from  the  central    position    due  to    Langevin  forces  are
immediately    contrasted  by  the  induced  pressure  difference  between
parts  A  and  B.  In  this  respect,  our  system,  in  which  parts  A  and  B  are
separated  by  the  adiabatic  movable  wall,  is  unique  in  that  the  piston
displacement  from  the  symmetric  position  X=L/2  gives  rise  to  a  fairly
small  restoration  force  (second  term  on  the  R.H.S  of  Eq.(8)),  whose
weakness  is  due  to  the  succession  of  contiguous  quasi-equilibrium
equal-pressure states characterizing the system evolution.
2. H-theorem, which would forbid any substantial entropy decrease, does
not apply to our case since one of the main hypotheses underlying this
theorem,  i.e.,  the  molecular  chaos  assumption,  is  not  fulfilled  by  our
system.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  hypothesis  amounts  to  assume  the
validity of the relation W(r,v;r,v') = W(r,v)W(r,v') between two-particle
and one-particle probability-density functions [1] ;  in our case the above
equation  cannot  be  satisfied  since,  while  W(r,v)  and  W(r,v')  are
independent from the signs of vx and v'x , the correlation induced by the
piston random motion favors a common sign of vx and v'x in W(r,v;r,v')
for  r  close  to  the  piston.  In  other  words,  our  system  does  not  violate
Boltzman's theorem but simply lies outside its realm of applicability, so
that no statement  can be a  priori   made about the  entropy  behavior.  In
fact,  while  the  system  entropy  decreases  if  the  initial  piston  position  is
close to X=L/2 (see Eq.(10)), it is possible to show that it increases if the
piston starts from a position X close to zero or to L.

the  second 

In  this  paper,  we  have  provided  what  we  believe  to  be  a  remarkable
example  of  a  physical  process  violating 
law  of
thermodynamics which states that "for any transformation occurring in
an isolated system, the entropy of the final state can never be less than
that  of  the  initial  state  ".  Actually,  the  second  law  cannot  always  be
proved in the frame of Statistical Mechanics. A proof of the second law
is  furnished  by  Boltzmann's  H-theorem,  provided  the  assumptions
underlying this theorem are satisfied by the considered isolated system.
In other words, H-theorem represents only a sufficient condition for the
validity of the Second Law. In our case, since one of the conditions for
its applicability (molecular chaos assumption) is not present, there is in
principle no reason why the second law could not be violated.

 A  few  comments  are  necessary  in  order  to  justify  the  model  upon
which the validity of our result is based. We start by noting that the mass
of our piston can be neither too large nor too small compared to that of

9

fulfilled 

the  gas.  In  fact,  in  the  first  case  we  would  violate  the  condition
M/2Mg<1  (see  after  Eq.(9)),  while  in  the  second  the  molecular  hits
would  cause  the  relevant  piston  displacement  to  take  place  on  a  time
scale too short to allow for the thermalization of the gas required in the
frame  of  our  model.  This  condition  can  be 
tas
@  (M/Mg)NL/vrms  (where  vrms  is  the  root  mean  square  velocity  of  the
gas)  is  larger  than  the  thermalization  time  tth (which  is  approximately
2
/"vrms  , where  "  is the gas mean free path), that is if
estimated to be  L
N>>(Mg/M)L/" . On the other hand, the values of N and L are limited by
the  constrain  that  tas  cannot  be  so  large  to  become  irrelevant.  Both
requirements can be satisfied for a gas in standard conditions by taking,
e.g., M/Mg=.01 and L of the order of a few microns. The corresponding
tas turns out to be of the order of a tenth of a second and tth of the order
of  hundreds  of  nanoseconds,[6]  while  the  value  of  the  relative  entropy
decrease ‰

‰ / D Sth  is of the order of 103.

We  wish  also  to  note  that  our  problem  is  analytically  treated  in  the
frame  of  Langevin  approach,  which  is  justified  whenever  the  random
force  corresponding  to  A(t)  can  be  considered  as  external,  i.e.,  its
properties as a function of time are supposed to be known (see, e.g., [7]).
In  our  case,  the  characteristic  time  scale  tc  of  A(t)  is  by  orders  of
magnitude  smaller  than  tas  and  tth.  Thus,  the  behavior  of  A(t)  is
essentially  not  influenced  by  the  slow  piston  dynamics,  so  that  the
random  forces  can  be  supposed  to  be  known  a  priori,  and  our  system
possesses the physical basis for a  separation  of  the  acting  forces  into  a
mechanical part and a random term with known properties. Accordingly,
our  system  can  be  modeled  by  considering  the  piston  as  a  particle
undergoing Brownian motion in a harmonic field, correctly described by
the Langevin approach.

We  note  that  in  a  very  recent  paper  [8]  the  problem  of  the  time
evolution of our system was considered by adopting a different approach
based on the introduction of the microscopical Boltzmann equation. The
conclusions  of  Ref.[8]  are  different  from  ours,  in  that  the  system
eventually  reaches  an  asymptotic  equilibrium  state  corresponding  to
maximum  entropy  and  no  violation  of  the  second  law  is  present.  We
believe  that  this  conclusion  strongly  depends  on  molecular  chaos
assumption, which is expedient for obtaining the results contained in [8].
In fact,  this  hypothesis inevitably leads, through  H-theorem,  to  entropy
maximization.  In  our  model,  no  a  priori  assumption  is  made  about
molecular chaos.

We wish finally to observe that the adiabatic piston problem has been
recently  mentioned  as  an  illustrative  example  of  thermal  evolution

10

whose  interpretation  may  involve  significant  changes  in  our  way  of
looking at the second law.[9]

In  conclusion,  we  have  investigated  a  thermal  isolated  system
characterized by a succession of contiguous quasi-equilibrium states, and
we have shown how it can undergo a large entropy decrease. At the best
of our knowledge, the situation described in this paper constitutes one of
the most peculiar examples of thermodynamical evolution of an isolated
system outside the realm of Boltzmann's H-theorem.

We wish to thank Noel Corngold for helpful discussions.
