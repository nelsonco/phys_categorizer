We demonstrate a 1 GHz prismless femtosecond Ti:sapphire ring laser which emits 890 mW for 7.6W of pump power over a continuum extending from 585 to 
1200 nm at -20 dB below the maximum. A broadband continuum is obtained without careful mirror dispersion compensation, with the net cavity group-delay-
dispersion having -50 to +100 fs2 oscillations from 700 to 900 nm. Further broadening is obtained by use of a slightly convex cavity mirror that increases self-
phase modulation. 17% (75%) of the intracavity (output) power is generated in single-pass through the crystal, outside the cavity bandwidth and concentrated 
in the low gain infrared region from 960 to 1200 nm. This laser seems well suited for optical frequency metrology, possibly allowing easier stabilization of the 
carrier-to-envelope offset frequency without use of photonic fibers.

Femtosecond lasers are the basis of optical frequency combs, 
which have revolutionized frequency metrology and precision 
measurements in the recent past years1. They have been used, 
for  example,  for  direct  measurements  of  frequencies  of 
several  hundred  THz 2 ,  in  optical  atomic  clocks 3  and  for 
phase-sensitive  nonlinear  optics  experiments 4
.  For 
measurement  and  control  of  the  carrier-to-envelope  offset 
frequency1  (fceo)  in  optical  frequency  combs,  a  femtosecond 
laser  whose  spectrum  covers  one  octave  is  desirable. 
Although the use of a microstructure fiber offers a solution to 
this,  there  are  problems  for  continuous  and  long-term 
operation,  which 
for  clocks  and  other 
applications. In this way, the advent of femtosecond lasers (in 
particular Ti:sapphire) emitting a broadband continuum5,6,7,8,9 
has  attracted  interest.  These  lasers  have  been  demonstrated 
with stationary-wave, longer cavities operating with prisms in 
order  to  compensate  for  group  delay  dispersion  (GDD),  or 
with  short,  traveling-wave,  prismless  ring  cavities  that  use 
chirped mirrors. In the first case, repetition rates are typically 
smaller,  near  100  MHz  or  below,  while  the  second  case 
allows for repetition rates of one Gigahertz or higher, which 
are  often  preferred  for  optical  frequency  measurements.  
Measurement  and  stabilization  of  fceo  has  also  been 
demonstrated  with  such  lasers7,8,9.  In  this  letter,  we  report 
what  to  our  knowledge  is  the  most  broadband  femtosecond 
spectrum  to  date,  obtained  from  a  Ti:sapphire  laser  whose 
spectrum  covers  from  585  to  1200  nm  at  a  level  of  -20  dB 
below the maximum. It operates stably with an output power 
of  890  mW  for  7.6  W  of  pump  power,  and  a  repetition  rate 
near  1  GHz.  We  discuss  its  characterization  and  the  points 
which  we  found  to  be  important  for  stable  ultra  broadband 
operation. 

The main laser cavity described here consists of a 4-
mirror  bow-tie  ring  cavity  comprising  two  curved  mirrors 
(including  the  input  coupler  (IC)),  with  broadband  high 
reflecting  (HR)  coatings  and  radius  of  curvature  of  3  cm,  a 
HR  flat  mirror  and  a  flat  output  coupler  (OC)  with  a 

transmission  of  2  %  from  730  to  870  nm.  All  mirrors  are 
commercially  available10 and  chirped,  with  GDD  of  -60  fs2 
from  720  to  990  nm,  excluding  the  OC.  In  another  cavity 
configuration  the  HR  flat  mirror  has  been  replaced  by  a 
broadband HR convex mirror (R = 1 m) in order to enhance 
self-phase  modulation  (SPM)  5.  A  3  mm-long  Brewster-cut 
Ti:sapphire  crystal  is  placed  at  the  cavity  tighter  waist 
between  the  curved  mirrors.  The  Ti3+  concentration  is  such 
that 70% of the power from a single-frequency pump laser at 
532 nm is absorbed. The net cavity GDD is shown in Fig.1. 
Curve (a) is an average of four traces obtained by white-light 
interferometry  11 ,  including  the  two  curved  mirrors,  the 
convex mirror, the Ti:sapphire crystal, but not the OC. Curve 
(b)  is  the  calculated  GDD  based  on  the  curves  of  the  same 
mirrors  provided  by  the  manufacturer,  and  combined  with  a 
Ti:sapphire  crystal  flat  GDD  of  +174  fs2 12.  Curve  (c)  is  the 
same as (b), but  with the convex  mirror replaced by the HR 
flat mirror. Curve (d) is the calculated GDD of the OC only, 
also provided by the manufacturer10. A few comments can be 
made from Fig.1: 1) the positive GDD of the crystal is nearly 
compensated  by  the  negative  GDD  of  the  chirped  mirrors, 
giving small negative net GDD in certain wavelength regions. 
Small negative net GDD is known to give short pulses13, 14; 2) 
oscillation  compensation  has  not  been  important  for  the 
generation of a broadband spectrum; 3) the net-GDD is even 
positive near the Ti:sapphire gain peak, from 760 to 800 nm. 

In  addition  to  the  cavity  described  above,  we  have 
also  built  two  ring  cavities  with  six  mirrors  and  reduced 
repetition  rate  of  920  MHz.  These  cavities  differ  from  the 
former one by the addition of two HR flat chirped mirrors (-
70fs2  from  720  to  1000  nm,  oscillation  compensated10)  and 
by  a  different  chirped  IC  (-40  fs2  from  700  to  850  nm,  HR 
from 650 to 900 nm). They differ from each other by the use 
of a flat HR chirped mirror (-60 fs2) or an unchirped mirror, 
such that the net cavity GDD (mirrors and crystal) amounted 
to -120 fs2  and  -60 fs2 respectively. The convex  mirror  was 
not  used.  In  either  case  we  could  not  generate  a  broadband

continuum.  Curve  a  in  Figure  2  corresponds  to  the  laser 
spectrum  for  either  of  these  6-mirror  cavities,  showing  a 
Gaussian profile centered at 777 nm, with a full-width at half-
maximum of 10 nm. Curve b corresponds to the spectrum for 
the  4-mirror  cavity  using  the  flat  HR  mirror  instead  of  the 
convex  one.  In  curves  c  and  d  the  convex  mirror  has  been 
used. Curves c and d differ from each other only by changes 
in the cavity alignment, as we explain below. 
A  significant  difference  between 

the  6-mirror 
cavities with excess negative net GDD (curve a in Fig.2) and 
the 4-mirror one (curves b-d of Fig.2), is their sensitivity for 
alignment  and  operation.  We  found  that  mode-locking  was 
more  difficult  to  achieve  for  the  6-mirror  cavities,  requiring 
careful  adjustment  of  the  curved  mirror  angles.  Precise 
positioning  of  the  curved  mirrors  with  respect  to  the  crystal 
was  also  required  to  eliminate  a  continuous-wave  (cw) 
component.  On  the  other  hand  the  4-mirror  cavity  mode-
locks  easily,  with  considerably  less  critical  adjustments.  No 
instabilities  associated  with  possible  Q-switching  operation 
were observed, as can be seen from the inset in Fig.3 which 
shows  a  beat  signal  at  the  laser  repetition  rate.  For  this  4-
mirror  cavity  using  the  convex  mirror  and  for  input  powers 
above 6 Watts, as the curved mirror opposing the IC is moved 
towards  the  crystal,  three  distinct  regions  can  be  identified 
near the inner edge of the 2.6-mm long stability range for the 
distance between these curved mirrors. In the first region the 
laser  oscillates  mode-locked  in  one  direction  of  the  ring 
cavity. An intermediate region is more sensitive to alignment, 
with  mode-locked  oscillation  alternating  between  both 
directions of the ring cavity, without any cw component. The 
third  region  is  similar  to  the  first,  but  the  laser  oscillates  in 
the  other  direction  with  respect  to  the  first  region.  We  note 
that there are similarities between this description and the one 
given  in  ref.  5.  Curve  b)  and  c)  in  Fig.  2  are  typical  spectra 
for  the  laser  operating  either  in  the  first  or  third  regions. 
These  spectra  are  quite  similar  to  those  in  refs.  5,  9  and  are 
obtained  either  with  the  flat  or  convex  HR  mirror,  showing 
that a broadband spectrum is primarily obtained when the net 
cavity  GDD  is  small.  Curve  d)  in  Fig.  2  corresponds  to 
operation  in  the  second  region  using  the  convex  mirror, 
which  adds  further  broadening.  We  have  not  determined  if 
these three regions are specifically associated with use of the 
convex mirror, and for input powers below 6 Watts only the 
first and third regions are observed. 

The  spectrum  of  curve  d  of  Fig.  2  is  quite 
remarkable,  extending  from  585  to  1200  nm  at  the  -20  dB 
level from the maximum at 986 nm, or at -10 dB with respect 
to the power at 800 nm. Since in our measurements the laser 
oscillation  direction  has  always  been  opposed  to  the  pump 
direction,  the  light  that  leaves  the  crystal  reflects  in  the  IC 
and  is  transmitted  through  the  OC.  The  peaks  in  the  laser 
spectrum at 660, 680 nm and 986 nm in curves c) and d) in 
Fig.2 occur at maxima in the OC transmission spectrum and 
the  dips  at  1190  and  1250  nm  are  simply  due  to  minima  of 
the  IC  reflection  spectrum.  Assuming  that  light  outside  the 
cavity  bandwidth  is  generated  in  only  a  single-pass  through 
the crystal, mainly by SPM and also by the Ti:sapphire gain, 

then  a  considerable  increase  in  output  power  would  be 
possible  simply  if  the  transmission/reflection  of  the  IC/OC 
could  be  optimized.  If  the  spectrum  of  curve  d  in  Fig.  2  is 
corrected  by  the  reflectivity  of  the  IC  and  OC  (Fig.  2),  we 
obtain  the  intracavity  power  spectrum.  By  defining  a  cavity 
bandwidth  (BW)  from  685  to  960  nm,  corresponding  to 
points  where  the  transmission  of  the  OC  increases  to  20% 
(vertical  lines  in  Fig.2),  we  integrated  the  intracavity  power 
spectrum  to  compute  which  fraction  is  generated  inside  the 
cavity  BW  and  which  fraction  is  generated  outside  it,  in 
single-pass through the crystal. We thus obtain the impressive 
number  that  17%  of  the  intracavity  power  is  generated  in 
single-pass  mainly  by  SPM  and  also  gain  in  the  crystal.  It 
follows  that  this  fraction  increases  to  75%  for  the  available 
power outside the cavity. Most of this power is concentrated 
in the infrared portion of the spectrum, from 960 to 1200 nm. 
It  is  possible  that  the  broadband  chirped  mirrors,  with  HR 
coatings and negative GDD extending up to 990 nm, the tight 
focus  in  a  relatively  long  crystal  (soft-aperture  KLM),  and 
high-order  dispersion  all  play  important  roles  for  this 
improved generation in the infrared. 

We  have  also  replaced  the  OC  by  another  mirror 
with  transmission  reduced  to  1%  over  the  same  spectral 
extension. In this case, the output power has been nearly the 
same,  and  the  spectrum  slightly  narrower.  The  use  of  a 
microstructure  fiber,  previously  employed  to  generate  a 
broadband  continuum  from  the  6-mirror  cavity  lasers,  does 
not cause any further spectral broadening. 

Figure 3 shows power curves for the 4-mirror cavity. 
The curve with triangles is for CW operation, with the cavity 
optimally aligned in the center of its stability curve. The high 
slope  efficiency  of  32  %  (1.5  W  for  5W  pumping)  and  the 
low  threshold  (350  mW)  are  consequences  of  the  compact 
design  with  tight  waist  size  in  the  crystal15.  The  curve  with 
circles  corresponds  to  the  spectrum  of  curve  c  in  Fig.  2, 
obtained  in  the  first  region  discussed  above.  We  obtain  a 
slope  efficiency  of  7  %  and  a  threshold  near  3  Watts  for 
mode-locked operation. 330 mW (560 mW) is obtained for 5 
W  (7  W)  of  pump  power.  Although  in  this  region  cw 
oscillation can occur for pump powers lower than 3 W, it has 
not been observed above that pump power. Curves a, b and c 
in  Fig.  2  were  obtained  for  5  W  pumping  and  curve  d  was 
obtained for 8 W. However there was no significant variation 
of  the  output  spectrum  as  a  function  of  input  power.  The 
curve  with  squares  in  Fig.  3  corresponds  to  the  broadest 
spectrum of curve d in Fig. 2, obtained in the second region 
discussed above. Here the curve is very nonlinear. It shows a 
bi-stable  regime  with  hysteresis,  with  the  power  sometimes 
changing  discontinuously  in  a  way  that  depends  on  whether 
the pump power is increased or decreased. By only changing 
the pump power, we can also observe two output powers for 
the same pump power. Mode-locked in this second region has 
always led to a broad continuum. For the 6-mirror cavities we 
obtained output powers of 550 mW for 5 W of pump power. 

In  summary,  we  have  demonstrated  a  1  GHz  fs 
Ti:sapphire prismless laser that emits a broadband continuum 
with an improved infrared spectrum. 75% of the output power

is  generated  in  a  single-pass  through  the  crystal,  mainly  by 
self-phase  modulation,  and  is  concentrated  in  the  spectral 
region  from  960  to  1200  nm,  outside  the  laser  cavity 
bandwidth  and  where  the  Ti:sapphire  gain  is  low.  The 
primary  condition  for  broadband  spectrum  is  attributed  to 
operating  this  compact  laser  cavity  at  small  negative  net 
GDD.  However  precise  oscillation  compensation  has  not 
been  important  and  the  net  cavity  GDD  is  found  to  be 
positive near the Ti:sapphire gain peak. The use of a slightly 
convex  mirror  contributed  to  additional  broadening.  We 
expect  that  this  ultra-broadband  laser  with  improved  IR 
spectrum  will  make easier to  measure and stabilize the laser 
carrier-to-envelope offset  frequency by  use of  nonlinear  f-2f 
spectrometers1, without use of microstructure photonic fibers.
