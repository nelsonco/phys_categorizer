Abstract

In  the  National  Spallation  Neutron  Source  (NSNS)
design,  a  180  meter  long  transport  line  connects  the  1
GeV  linac  to  an  accumulator  ring.  The linac  beam  has  a
current  of 28 mA,  pulse  length  of    1  ms,  and  60  Hz  rep
rate. The high energy transport line consists of sixteen 600
FODO  cells, and accommodates a 900  achromatic bend,
an  energy  compressor,  collimators,  part  of  the  injection
system,  and  enough  diagnostic  devices  to  measure  the
beam quality before injection. To reduce the uncontrolled
beam  losses,  this  line  has  nine  beam  halo  scrapers  and
very  tight  tolerances  on  both  transverse  and  longitudinal
beam  dynamics  under  space  charge  conditions.  The
design of this line is presented.

 1 INTRODUCTION

In the 1 MW NSNS [1], the High-Energy Beam Transfer
line  (HEBT)  connects  the  1  GeV  linac  [2]  to  an
accumulator ring [3].  A major requirement of all parts of
this  accelerator  is  to  have  low  uncontrolled  beam  losses
(£
  1  nA/m),  to  allow  hands  on  maintenance.  To  achieve
such low beam losses in the accumulator, the beam must
be  prepared  very  carefully  before  injection.    The  HEBT
not only matches the beam into the accumulator, but also
determines  the  beam  quality  at  injection.  The  HEBT  is
equipped  with  nine  sets  of  beam  halo  scrapers,  and  the
ratio of aperture to rms beam size is kept greater than 10
throughout  the  line.  The  maximum  magnetic  field  in
dipoles and quadrupoles is kept less than 3 kG, to keep H-
stripping losses to acceptable levels. In addition, one must
maintain very tight tolerances on elements.  Fig. 1 shows
the HEBT line.  Table 1 gives the Twiss parameters at the
entrance and exit of the HEBT.

2 FUNCTIONS OF THE HEBT LINE

The  HEBT  has  the  following  functions,  which  we  have
managed to decouple: (a) matching of the beam from the
linac into the transport line, (b) momentum  selection,  (c)
momentum  compaction,  (d)  preparation  of  the  beam  for
injection.  In addition, one must characterize the beam out
of  the  linac  and  before  injection,  and  cleanup  any  beam
halo. We can consider the HEBT as having three sections:
Linac-Achromat  Matching  Section  (LAMS),  Achromat,
and  Achromat-Ring  Matching  Section  (ARMS).  In
addition  to the  bend to  the  ring,  there  is  a  straight  beam
line used for linac beam characterization, as shown in Fig.
1.    The  first  four  cells  (11.4  m/cell)  after  the  linac

poration of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

The  energy  compressor  cavity  is  located  in  the  first  cell
following  the  achromat  (in  the  ARMS),  where  the
dispersion and  its  derivative  are  zero.  The  remaining  six
cells  (8  m/cell)  are  used  for  matching  the  beam  into  the
accumulator ring, diagnostics, and for beam halo scrapers.
Every  quadrupole  in  the  HEBT  is  followed  by  a  small

dipole magnet for steering of the beam in the quadrupole
focusing-plane.    To  keep  the  uncontrolled  beam  losses
low, a study of the required alignment tolerances [4], has
led to the following requirements (a) translation errors (x
and y) of < 0.1 mm, (b) pitch and yaw of  < 0.1 mrad, (c)
rotation of < 0.5 deg.

Linac to Achromat Matching Section

The  linac  has  a  FDOO  lattice  with  a  phase  advance  of
about 19(cid:176) /cell, and the achromat has a FODO lattice with
60(cid:176) /cell  phase  advance.    The  first  two  cells  (four
quadrupoles)  of  the  HEBT  provide  a  smooth  transition
between  the  two.  To  remove  any  linac  beam  halo,  there
are two movable and two fixed collimators located in the
2nd to 5th half-cells in this section.  The 6th and 7th half-
cells  are  kept  for  kickers  required  in  a  future  upgrade.
The  space  between  quadrupoles  in  the  first  cell  of  the
HEBT is occupied by beam diagnostics.

Momentum Selection (Achromat)
A 90(cid:176)  achromatic bend starts at the 5th cell of the HEBT
line,  and  finishes  in  six  cells,  containing  twelve  7.5(cid:176)
dipoles. The total phase advance in the achromat is 360(cid:176) .
A beam energy-halo scraper  is  located  at the middle  cell
of  the  achromat,  where  the  dispersion  is  maximum  (8.9
meter).      Fig.  2  shows  amplitude  functions  (b X, b Y)  and
dispersion function (h ) along the HEBT.  The first dipole
of the achromat is a switching magnet to provide beam to
the straight linac dump.

Achromat to Ring Matching Section

After  the  achromat,  two  cells  are  provided  for  the
diagnostics  and  beam  collimators.  At  the  end  of  the
achromat  this  line  is  parallel  to  the  ring  straight  section,
but  offset  by  10  m,  allowing  one  to  have  the  required
“dog  leg''  for  injection  into  the  ring.  These  bends  are
necessary to allow the dispersion and its derivative to  be
zero at the injection stripper foil.  As shown in Fig. 2, the
dispersion  has  a  minimum  and  maximum  of  similar
amplitude  but  opposite  sign  through  the  “dogleg”.    This
section  has  enough  quadrupoles  to  match  six  variables
(four  amplitude  functions  and  two  dispersion  functions).
There is no vertical bend and no vertical dispersion.  The
locations  of  the  dipoles  are  determined  by  the  injection
the  phase  space  particle
scheme.

Momentum Compaction

Momentum compaction is accomplished with a 2.6 meter
long, 16 cell, 805 MHz rf cavity with a gradient of 1.375
MV/m.   This cavity  is  similar  to  the last  cavity  of  linac.
The  cavity  is  located  in  the  first  half-cell  after  the
achromat  (130  m  from  the  linac),  where  the  dispersion
and its derivative both have zero values. This location of
the cavity can provide the desired momentum spread for a

3 SPACE CHARGE AND MOMENTUM SPREAD

/s 0, where s

 and s 0
The tune depression is defined as m =s
are  the  tune  with  and  without  space  charge.  Table  2
shows these values for different beam currents.  The tune
depression for the  1  MW and  2  MW cases  is  almost  the
same, because the  emittance  is larger  in  the  2  MW  case.
To  simulate  space  charge  effects  we  have  used
TRACE3D  and  PARMILA  programs.  Fig.  3  shows  the
TRACE3D output for  1  MW.   The momentum  spread  at
the exit of the linac is 0.678 MeV for 28 mA. There is no
longitudinal  focusing  in  the  line  until  the  momentum
compression  cavity. The momentum  spread  at  the  cavity
and at the foil for different currents is also shown.

Diagnostics

In addition to the straight-ahead linac diagnostic line, one
needs  enough  diagnostic  devices  spread  over  the  entire
HEBT to determine beam losses and beam quality before
injection. There is one beam loss monitor per quadrupole
and  one  per  dipole,  with  another  27  left  for  additional
critical locations.

Beam  position  monitors  (x  and  y)  are  located  near
each  quadrupole.  Harps,  which  will  only  be  used  at  low
repetition rate due to thermal constraints, will allow beam
profile  measurements  to  be  made  at  the  entrance  to  the
achromat,  middle  of  the  achromat,  and  entrance  to  the
ring.    Using  profiles  from  four  crawling-wire  profile
monitors  located  between  four  consecutive  quadrupole
magnets, one can infer the beam emittance.  There will be
two of these four-profile units, one at the exit of the linac,
and  one  before  the  entrance  to  the  ring.    Bunch  shape
monitors  (detailed  bunch  shape),  wall  current  monitors
(continuous monitoring of coarse bunch shape), and time-
of-flight energy monitors (continuous monitoring of beam
energy)  will  be  located  at  the  output  of  the  linac  and
output  of  the  debuncher  cavity  (with  an  additional  wall
current  monitor  at  the  entrance  to  the  debuncher).
Finally, current toroids  will allow continuous monitoring
of  beam  current  at  four  locations.    The  diagnostics  are
shown in Fig 1.

Halo Scraping (Collimation)

for 

There are a total of nine collimators in the HEBT, one for
momentum  collimation  and  eight 
transverse
collimation. Four transverse collimators  (2  each in x and
y) are located just after  the linac, and  the other four  in  a
zero-dispersion region just after the compressor cavity. Of
these eight collimators, the four horizontal collimators are
movable  foils,  which  strip  the  H-  to  H+,  which  is  then
dumped,  after  horizontal  defocusing,  in  the  same  dump
that  is  used  for  fixed  vertical  collimation  [5].    This
reduces  costs,  and  has  the  added  advantage  of  being
adjustable 
the  bending  plane.  The  momentum
collimator is located at  the  maximum  dispersion  point in
the achromat. This scraper is a pair of movable  stripping
foils  in  the  middle  of  the  bend  section,  followed  by  an
off-line beam dump  for  the oppositely bent  protons.   All
collimators  are  designed  to  handle  10–3  of  the  beam,  but
we  expect  any  one  to  intercept  less  than  10–4.  The
configuration 
shown
schematically in Fig. 5.
