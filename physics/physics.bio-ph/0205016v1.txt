We have investigated the electrical conductivity of λ-DNA using DNA covalently bonded to Au
electrodes. Thiol-modiﬁed dTTP was incorporated into the ‘sticky’ ends of bacteriophage λ-DNA
using DNA polymerase. Two-probe measurements on such molecules provide a hard lower bound
for the resistivity ρ > 106 Ωcm at bias potentials up to 20 volts, in conﬂict with recent claims of
moderate to high conductivity. By direct imaging, we show that the molecules are present after the
measurements. We stress the importance of eliminating salt residues in these measurements.

The question whether DNA is electrically conducting
has generated broad interest. The initial spurt of interest
arose in photoexcitation experiments which were inter-
preted in terms of long-range electron transfer [1]. In the
past few years, there have been upwards of 20 papers re-
porting the results of more direct electrical measurements
ranging from contactless meaurements at microwave fre-
quencies to DC measurements. A distressingly wide
range of conductivity values – from ρ < 10−4 Ωcm
to ρ > 106 Ωcm – has been reported [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Proximity-induced superconductivity in DNA has also
been claimed [7]. Recently, local polarization measure-
ments by ‘electrostatic force microscopy’ have been used
to show that λ-DNA is insulating [8, 9]. We note, how-
ever, that the force-microscopy experiments probe con-
ductivity at relatively weak bias potentials.

In many of the DC measurements, contact with the
metal electrodes (usually Au) was achieved by laying
down the molecules directly on the electrodes. Although
expedient, this approach raises several concerns.
It is
very diﬃcult to prove that the DNA molecule is in direct
physical contact with the electrodes. Even if contact is
attained, the weak physical adhesion between DNA and
Au may produce an insulating contact and possibly ac-
count for the wide variation in reported resistivities [10].
A recent experiment on octanedithiol [11] has shown that
deliberate chemical bonding between organic molecules
and metal electrodes is a pre-requisite for achieving re-
producible conductivity results. Thus a better approach
would be to achieve direct chemical binding between the
open ends of λ-DNA and Au. The bonds should be strong
enough to withstand shear forces in a ﬂow, and should
survive the measurement process. A second concern is
the shunting eﬀect of buﬀer residue. Because of its ﬁnite
conductance, the buﬀer salts which coat the electrodes
and substrate produce a spurious conductance signal.
Hence adequate salt removal is important. We report
the results of experiments performed along these lines.
Our results show that λ-DNA is a good insulator up to
bias potentials of 20 volts.

Chemical binding between organic molecules and Au is
usually achieved by the Au-thiol (SH) chemical bond [12].
Commercially available oligonucleotides modiﬁed to in-

corporate the thiol group usually have carbon-chain spac-
ers (C3 or C6) between the thiol group and DNA [3, 6,
13], which may present barriers to electron transfer. To
avoid the spacer problem, we adopted an approach in
which the DNA base-pair is bound directly to gold elec-
trodes by a Au-thiol bond. This approach should provide
the most direct conductance channel between the gold
electrode and the putative electronic “π-way” proposed
for the DNA helix [14].

λ-DNA is a double-stranded helix comprised of 48,502
base pairs (length ∼ 16 µm). At the extremities, there
are single-stranded 12-base 5’ overhangs (‘sticky ends’),
with the complementary sequences

where A,C,G,T are the nucleotides adenine, cytosine,
guanine and thymine, respectively. Our technique re-
lies on the incorporation of T’s modiﬁed to include the
desired thiol group [15, 16]. The ‘sticky’ ends are ﬁlled
in by a standard reaction [17] using the Klenow frag-
ment of DNA polymerase and the three deoxynucleoside
triphosphates dATP, dGTP, and S4-dTTP (see Fig. 1-
A). Because of the preponderance of modiﬁed dTTPs
(and absence of dCTP) in solution, we can incorporate a
signiﬁcant number of modiﬁed T’s at both ends of each
DNA molecule [18]. To prevent the Klenow fragment
from excising T’s that are not Watson-Crick matched to
the template, we use a mutated form of the Klenow frag-
ment which lacks the 3’→5’ proof-reading activity [19].
We tested the incorporation of the nucleotides into the
DNA ends by a ligation assay [20]. Unmodiﬁed λ-DNA
is readily ligated by T4 DNA ligase to form multimers.
In the modiﬁed λ-DNA, however, the sticky ends – now
ﬁlled in by the incorporated bases – are blunt, and multi-
mer formation is strongly suppressed. The reaction prod-
ucts were analyzed by pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis. As
shown in Fig. 1-B, unmodiﬁed λ-DNA (“natural-λ”) was
eﬃciently ligated (lane 3). To control for the possibility
that unincorporated S4-dTTP inhibited ligation, λ-DNA
monomers were ligated in the presence of all 3 dNTP’s
minus the polymerase (“control-λ”), and the ligation was
also eﬃcient (lane 6). The majority of the thiol-modiﬁed
λ-DNA (“HS-λ”), however, remained as monomers (lane

5). This provides strong evidence that the protocol is
eﬀective in incorporating bases into the ends of λ-DNA.

to the electrodes at one end. The unattached molecules
were carefully rinsed in 1×TE [23]. The chip was then
covered with a clean coverslip, and a ﬂow of the buﬀer
solution was applied perpendicular to the electrodes. We
observed that DNA molecules anchored at one end were
stretched by the buﬀer ﬂow to bridge the space between
the electrodes. Many of these molecules subsequently
attached to the second electrode by their free end. Af-
ter this occurs, the ﬂow may be repeatedly reversed to
demonstrate that the anchored DNA molecules bow out
with the ﬂow while their ends remain anchored (Panels
A and B of Fig. 2. See video in Ref. [24]). This is di-
rect evidence that chemical binding between the ends to
Au is much stronger than physical adhesion of the rest
of the molecule to either quartz or Au. (For the speciﬁc
DNA samples used in the resistivity measurements, we
carried out the dye-staining step after the measurements
to avoid inadvertent damage from dye intercalation.)

Using standard photolithography, we constructed Au
electrodes on a quartz substrate in parallel strips, 4 µm
wide and 5 mm long, and separated by 4 or 8 µm. The
Au surfaces were rigorously cleaned [22] before deposit-
ing the modiﬁed DNA. At several stages during these
experiments, it was important to observe the molecules
in an optical microscope. To image the thiol-modiﬁed
DNA molecules, we stained them with the ﬂuorescent
intercalating dye TOTO1 (Molecular Probes), and then
loaded them on the chip. After a 20-min. incubation pe-
riod, many of the molecules were observed to be attached

(N.A.=1.4), and excited by a collimated Ar:Kr ion laser at
488 nm. Fluorescence images were collected at 533 nm by an
intensiﬁed CCD camera (RoperScientiﬁc, Princeton Instru-
ments) and digitally enhanced. Au electrodes appear as ver-
tical stripes. Arrows represent the ﬂow direction. Panel A-1

As discussed above, a crucial step in the experiment
was the removal of buﬀer. In preliminary experiments, we
repeatedly observed a ﬁnite, semiconductor-like, history-
dependent conductance after loading DNA solution and

resentative I-V curve of the buﬀer salt residue, 1×TE.
Such spurious signals are of particular concern when
DNA is laid down on electrodes in a thick bundle, be-
cause the salts trapped between the DNA molecules can
form conduction paths. The spurious background van-
ished after we adopted the following procedure. Chips
containing bridging DNA molecules were carefully rinsed
in 5 mM ammonium acetate (NH4Ac, pH 6.6), a volatile
buﬀer that can be completely removed in high vacuum.
A drawback of this rinsing is that a large fraction of the
anchored DNA molecules are cut after rinsing and dry-
ing. However, rinsing in 10 mM MgSO4/40 mM Tris-
HCl (pH 8) before the NH4Ac rinsing introduces Mg2+
ions which coat the quartz surface with weak positive
charges [6]. As the negatively charged DNA molecules
stick to the substrate by electrostatic interaction, dam-
age due to NH4Ac rinsing is minimized. Panel C of Fig. 2
shows a typical image of anchored DNA after Mg2+ and

led to binding of unmodiﬁed λ-DNA. However, the yield
of anchored molecules was much smaller.]

To perform the electrical measurements, unstained
thiol-modiﬁed λ-DNA was attached to the Au electrodes
as described above. After the ﬁnal NH4Ac rinsing, the
chip was dried in the dark to avoid possible photon-
induced damage. Two-probe I-V measurements were
performed in moderately high vacuum (< 10−7Torr).

A typical room-temperature I-V curve, measured on
λ-DNA spanning electrodes 4 µm apart,
is shown in
the main panel of Fig.3. The voltage was swept be-
tween ±20 V. A linear ﬁt to the data in Fig. 3 yields
dI/dV = (−3 ± 9) × 10−14S. Using a cross-section of ∼3
nm2 per molecule, and the estimated number of bridging
molecules (∼1000), we obtain the bound on the resistiv-
ity of ρ > 106 Ωcm in electric ﬁelds E up to ∼ 104V/cm.
Measurements performed on several chips yielded consis-
tent results. No current was detected within the noise
level of our measurement(∼ ±10 pA), despite sustained
and deliberate eﬀorts to improve electrical contacts be-
tween the base pair stack of λ-DNA and Au.

Immediately after the measurements, a buﬀer solution
with an appropriate amount of TOTO1 dye dissolved in
1×TE was loaded on the chip. By direct optical mi-
croscopy inspection of the post-stained DNA, we con-
ﬁrmed that there were ∼1000 DNA molecules bridging
the electrodes, and thus the measurements did not de-
stroy the DNA.

As a ﬁnal check that the observed images are those of
λ-DNA, we introduce DNase to digest the molecules [28].
Complete deletion of all ﬂuorescent DNA molecules was
observed. These tests leave very little room for doubt
that a large number of intact DNA molecules were chem-
ically bound to the electrodes during the electrical mea-
surements.

data. The inset shows the two-probe I-V curve for a test chip

large bias potential applied (20 V) is at odds with
many recent reports of moderately high conductivity.
In some DC experiments, the DNA molecules formed
bundles or networks between the microfabricated elec-
trodes [25, 26, 27]. As noted above, high conductance
may arise from residual salts trapped between the DNA
strands. Contamination from other sources (C or Re)
may be a problem as well in the experiment on proximity-
induced superconductivity in λ-DNA [7]. Microwave
absorption experiments have been used to infer that
ρ ≃ 1 Ωcm at 295 K in λ-DNA [29]. The high conductiv-
ity inferred in these experiments (106 times larger than
our bound) is very diﬃcult to reconcile with our data. If
λ-DNA had such a high conductivity, virtually all our ap-
plied potential should fall across the contacts (∼2-3 nm)
to produce an E-ﬁeld ∼ 108 V/cm, high enough to pro-
duce a large tunneling current, if not breakdown of the
contact barrier altogether. We do not observe non-linear

I-V curves in our rigorously characterized and prepared
samples.

Two groups recently used electrostatic force mi-
croscopy to probe the electrostatic polarization of
DNA [8, 9]. Our results are consistent with their con-
clusion that DNA is insulating. However, the electro-
static force microscopy technique probes conductivity in
the limit of weak bias potentials, so it does not rule out a
transition to moderately large conductivity above a bias
threshold of several volts (as reported in some experi-
ments [4, 30]). The present experiments show that insu-
lating behavior extends to bias potentials as high as 20
volts.

[18] One 5’ overhang of the λ-DNA ends with an A, which
is Watson-Crick matched to S4-T. The other overhang
ends with G’s, which are matched to C’s. While sulfur-
modiﬁed dCTP is available, the sulphur is remote from
H atoms and the resonant thiol group can not form. To
maximize the probability of modiﬁed T’s at both ends,
we excluded dCTP altogether from the reaction, so that
S4-T:G pairing could occur in place of C:G. The mutated
Klenow fragment used here is incapable of detecting the
mis-matches.

[19] The Klenow fragment is a large fragment of DNA poly-
merase I lacking the error-correcting 5’→3’ exonucle-
ase activity (this function damages the λ-DNA ‘sticky’
ends). Here, we employed a mutated form of the Klenow
fragment (3’→5’ exo
, New England Biolabs) in which
the proof-reading 3’→5’ exonuclease activity is deleted.
S4-dTTP binds more weakly to A than unmodiﬁed
dTTP [16], and hence the proof-reading activity could
possibly remove incorporated S4-dTTP.
