Abstract

Computational methods for electromagnetic and light scattering can be used for the calculation of optical
forces and torques. Since typical particles that are optically trapped or manipulated are on the order of the
wavelength in size, approximate methods such as geometric optics or Rayleigh scattering are inapplicable, and
solution or either the Maxwell equations or the vector Helmholtz equation must be resorted to. Traditionally,
such solutions were only feasible for the simplest geometries; modern computational power enable the rapid
solution of more general—but still simple—geometries such as axisymmetric, homogeneous, and isotropic
scatterers. However, optically-driven micromachines necessarily require more complex geometries, and their
computational modelling thus remains in the realm of challenging computational problems. We review our
progress towards efﬁcient computational modelling of optical tweezers and micromanipulation, including the
trapping and manipulation of complex structures such as optical micromachines. In particular, we consider
the exploitation of symmetry in the modelling of such devices.

Introduction

Optical tweezers have seen deployment in a wide range of applications in biology, soft materials, microassem-
bly, and other ﬁelds. As well as being used for the trapping and manipulation of a wide range of natural and
artiﬁcial objects, optically trapped probes are used to measure forces on the order of piconewtons. Compared
with this diverse range of experimental applications, theory and accurate computational modelling of opti-
cal tweezers has received much less attention and has remained relatively undeveloped, especially for non-
spherical particles and non-Gaussian beams. This is unfortunate, especially when we consider the growing
ﬁelds of controlled rotation of complex microparticles—prototype optically-driven micromachines—and fully
three-dimensional manipulation using complex optical ﬁelds, where the application of theory and modelling
provide insight into the physics, and allow engineering and optimisation.

Since optical forces and torques result from the transfer of momentum and angular momentum from the
trapping beam to the particle via scattering, the theory and computational modelling of optical tweezers is,
in essence, the theory and computational modelling of the scattering of light or electromagnetic radiation.
Since typical particles that are optically trapped or manipulated are on the order of the wavelength in size,
approximate methods such as geometric optics or Rayleigh scattering are inapplicable, and solution or either
the Maxwell equations or the vector Helmholtz equation must be resorted to. As scattering by particles in
this size range is of interest in many ﬁelds, a wide variety of analytical and computational methods have
been developed. Thus, there is a solid foundation on which to develop computational modelling of optical
micromanipulation.

There are, however, complications that prevent simple direct application of typical light-scattering codes.
The ﬁrst, but not necessarily the most important, is that optical tweezers makes use of a highly focussed laser
beam, while most existing scattering codes assume plane wave illumination. Perhaps more fundamental is
the need for a large number of repeated calculations to characterise an optical trap—even for an axisymmetric
(but nonspherical) particle trapped in a circularly polarised Gaussian beam, we already have four degrees of
freedom. Clearly, this places strong demands on computational efﬁciency.

Due to this requirement for repeated calculation of scattering by the same particle, we employ the T-matrix
method [1, 2]. Below, we outline the employment of the T-matrix method for the calculation of optical forces
and torques. While most implementations of the T-matrix method are restricted to simple geometries, this is
not a limitation inherent in the method; fundamentally, the T-matrix method is a description of the scattering
properties of a particle, not a method of calculating the scattering properties. Therefore, in principle, any
method of calculating scattering can be used to obtain the T-matrix for a scatterer. We discuss such “hybrid”
methods, where a computational method not usually associated with the T-matrix method is used to calculate
the T-matrix of a scatterer, and hence the optical force and torque.

1

A further important consideration is that optical micromachines, while complex, are likely to possess a high
degree of symmetry; this can be exploited to reduce computation times by orders of magnitude. We demon-
strate the effectiveness of this approach by modelling the optical trapping and rotation of a cube. The two
principal symmetries of such shapes—mirror symmetry and discrete rotational symmetry about the normal to
the mirror symmetry plane—are exactly the symmetries that typify the ideal optically-driven rotor.

2 T-matrix formalism for optical force and torque

The T-matrix method in wave scattering involves writing the relationship between the wave incident upon a
scatterer, expanded in terms of a sufﬁciently complete basis set of functions ψ(inc)
labelling the functions, each of which is a solution of the Helmholtz equation,

where an are the expansion coefﬁcients for the incident wave, and the scattered wave, also expanded in terms

,

where pk are the expansion coefﬁcients for the scattered wave, is written as a simple matrix equation

or, in more concise notation,

where Tkn are the elements of the T-matrix. The T-matrix formalism is a Hilbert basis description of scattering.
The T-matrix depends only on the properties of the particle—its composition, size, shape, and orientation—
and the wavelength, and is otherwise independent of the incident ﬁeld.

This means that for any particular particle, the T-matrix only needs to be calculated once, and can then
be used for repeated calculations. This is the key point that makes this an attractive method for modelling
optical tweezers, providing a signiﬁcant advantage over many other methods of calculating scattering where
the entire calculation needs to be repeated.

The natural choice of basis functions when describing scattering by a compact particle is to use vector
spherical wavefunctions (VSWFs) [1]. The optical force and torque are given by sums of products of the modal
amplitudes [3, 4, 5].

Notably, neither how the VSWF expansion of the incident ﬁeld nor how the T-matrix can be calculated has
entered the above description of scattering. A variety of methods exist for the former [6, 5], and the latter task
is generally the more challenging computationally.

Most implementations of the T-matrix method use the extended boundary condition method (EBCM), also
called the null ﬁeld method, to calculate the T-matrix. This is so widespread that the T-matrix method and
the EBCM are sometimes considered to be inseparable, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
However, from the description above, it is clear that the T-matrix formalism is independent of the actual
method used to calculate the T-matrix [7, 8].

A number of alternative methods have been used for the calculation of T-matrices. Notably, such “hybrid”
methods, for example the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method used by Mackowski [9] can be used for
the calculation of T-matrices for particles of arbitrary shape, internal structure, and electromagnetic properties.
Complex internal structure will generally require a discretisation of the internal volume of the particle, rather
than a method based on surface discretisation. We are working on both ﬁnite-difference frequency-domain
(FDFD) and DDA based hybrid T-matrix solvers.

3 Optical torque and symmetry

The T-matrix elements are strongly dependent on the symmetry of the scatterer [1]. We can deduce the prin-
cipal features from Floquet’s theorem, relating solutions to differential equations to the periodicity of their
boundary conditions.

If we have a scatterer with nth-order rotational symmetry about the z-axis, an incident mode of azimuthal
index m couples to scattered modes with azimuthal indices m, m ± n, m ± 2n, m ± 3n and so on. For scatterers

that are mirror-symmetric, upward and downward coupling must be equal, in the sense that, for example, a
mirror-symmetric scatterer of 2nd order rotational symmetry (such as a long rod), T-matrix elements coupling
from m = 1 modes to m = −1 modes will have the same magnitudes as the elements coupling from m = −1
to m = 1 modes. For chiral scatterers, these T-matrix elements will, in general, be different.

This directly affects the optical torque; the vector spherical wavefunctions are eigenfunctions of the angular
momentum operators J2 and Jz. Essentially, the radial mode index n gives the magnitude of the angular
momentum ﬂux, while the azimuthal mode index m gives the z-component of the angular momentum ﬂux.
Therefore, the coupling between orders of different m describes the generation of optical torques about the
beam axis.

For the case of a rotationally symmetric scatterer, this means that there is no coupling between modes with
differing angular momenta about the z-axis[1, 10, 11]. Therefore, it is not possible to exert optical torque on
such scatterers except by absorption (or gain)—since the incoming and outgoing angular momenta per photon
are the same, the only optical torque can result from a change in the number of photons. In general, the use
of absorption for the transfer of optical torque is impractical, due to excessive heating. Therefore, a departure
from rotational symmetry is required. This can be either at the macroscopic (the shape of the particle) or
microscopic (optical properties of the particle) level.

Birefringent and elongated or ﬂattened particles are simple examples of introducing such asymmetry; no-
tably, such particles were the ﬁrst to be controllably optically rotated through means other than absorption,
for example by Beth in the ﬁrst measurements of optical torque [12]. Particles with these properties have also
been rotated in optical traps [13, 14, 15, 16]. As such particles can still be axisymmetric about one axis, rapid
calculation of optical forces and torques is still possible [15, 16]

More complex particles have also been fabricated and rotated [17, 18, 19], but in these cases, there are few

results from computational modelling [20].

As such structures typically possess discrete rotational symmetry, the restrictions on coupling between
azimuthal orders can be used to reduce the number of T-matrix elements that need to be calculated. This can
greatly reduce the time required. This is also the case for the hybrid methods described above. For a scatterer
with pth-order discrete rotational symmetry, it is only necessary to perform calculations for a 1/p portion of
the entire structure. If, in addition, there is mirror symmetry about the xy plane, the parity of the VSWFs
will be preserved. Therefore, an odd-n TE mode will only couple to odd-n TE modes and even-n TM modes.
This halves number of non-zero T-matrix elements, and halves the portion of the structure that needs to be
modelled.

4 Example: optical trapping of a cube

A simple example illustrating both the relationship between optical torque and symmetry, and the exploitation
of particle symmetry for more efﬁcient calculation of optical forces and torques, is the optical trapping of a
cube. The cube embodies both of the symmetries—mirror symmetry and discrete rotational symmetry about
the normal to the mirror symmetry plane—that typify the ideal optically-driven rotor.

As the cube has 4th-order rotational symmetry, and mirror symmetry with respect to the Cy plane, each
incident modes only couples to approximately 1/8 the number of signiﬁcant scattered modes. Although the
column-by-column calculation of the T-matrix still requires the same number of least-squared solutions, each
of this is of a smaller system of equations, and much faster. For example, the two wavelengths wide cube used
in our example below required 30 minutes for the calculation of the T-matrix on a 32 bit single-processor 3 GHz
microcomputer, as compared with 30 hours for an object of the same size lacking the cube’s symmetries. Only
one octant of the cube was explicitly included in the calculation.

If ﬁgure 1, we show the optical force and torque exerted on a cube with relative refractive index of 1.19 =
1.59/1.34, and faces 2λ across, where λ is the wavelength in the surrounding medium. Once the T-matrix is
calculated, to calculate the optical force and torque at a particular position requires less than 1 second (unless
the point is far from the beam focus, in which case, up to 10 seconds or so can be needed).

In ﬁgure 1(a), we see that cubic shapes can be stably trapped axially, while 1(b)–(d) show that optical
torque can be generated by such structures. The increased efﬁciency resulting from the use of orbital angular
momentum [5] is clear.

5 Conclusion

The symmetry properties of a scatterer can be used to dramatically speed the calculation of the scattering
properties of a particle. If these are expressed in the form of the T-matrix, this enables rapid and efﬁcient
calculation of optical forces and torques. Since typical optically-driven microrotors possess discrete rotational
symmetry, they are ideal candidates for this method. In addition, mirror symmetry about a plane can also

particles with geometries or internal structure making them unsuitable for traditional methods of calculating
T-matrices.
